This past weekend I accomplished my first weekend trip to Brussels, Belgium! I got back from class on Thursday, actually feeling sick as a dog. I think the first week of class took a tool on me, and I had the worst headache ever and I was extremely tired. I felt really bad because Pilar cooked me this huge lunch, with croquetas (which are really hard to make and she knows I love them!), jamón iberico, which is the most expensive type of jamón, and turkey, avocado salad, cheese, etc. I ate as much as I could but in the end I told her I just didn't feel well and that I couldn't eat anymore. She was very gracious as always!

I went to Michael's apartment with my backpack, which was pretty light because it's massive for 3 days worth of packing, and met up with him and Colton, his SLU friend who lives with him and was also going to Brussels. We took the metro to the airport, which was good to figure it out early, because that's the cheapest way of traveling there (i.e., free).

We found our way through security (they actually make you take your toiletries out, so Connor, no taking your huge gels through in Madrid), and waited at the gate. We took RyanAir, which was not that bad, similar to Spirit, except the landing was a huge BOOM and literally everyone on the plane screamed because it was such a harsh landing.

Once we landed, we took a bus to the city center because we flew into Charleroi, an airport about an hour south of Brussels. Then we got on the metro to go closer to our hostel, which was hilarious because first of all we couldn't figure out where to go (everything was written in Flemmish and French), and once we could, it said our train was coming in 20 minutes. Then it arrived and it was this *dinky* two car "metro" that looked like if I touched it everything would fall apart. It was a drastic change from the metro in Madrid, where, if it says the next train is coming in 5 minutes, that's a huge drag.

We walked down the river to our hostel, Meininger, and checked in. Unfortunately, I was placed in a room by myself (meaning not with any of our friends who came), but it turned out okay because I paid for a 10 person room, but was placed in a 4 person room. I felt much safer, and honestly the hostel was extremely nice. The shower was better than my shower in my Spanish home! When I got there, no one was in the room, but I locked up my stuff and we headed out for the night.

We were super hungry, and we decided to get something we found along the way. We passed a place called Georgette which was selling food from a window (it also had a café), so we all ordered fries because we knew they were a Belgium specialty. We were sooo happy with our decision. The fries were piping hot and **so good**. Also, all fries in Brussels come with some type of sauce (there's usually over 30 kinds!), and we all fell in love with the sauce.

Before we got to Brussels, I knew there was this bar called Delirium that has over 3,000 types of beer, so we went there right away. They had about 32 beers on tap, so we ordered some of them and took them to a table. I don't know a lot about beer, but I know I liked the ones I had! The place was super cool, and packed with people. Delirium is like a huge producer of beer in Belgium, and it has its own allyway where there's also an absynth bar and a tequila bar that have 50/100+ types of their drinks. We did not go into those places, haha!

Afterwards, we wanted fries again, so we walked into the only place that was open and got fries. This will be the second of many, many times.

The first night I noticed that Brussels is a lot more of a pedestrian city than Madrid. A lot of the streets are tiny, only able to fit one car, but there were rarely cars on those streets anyways, probably because the drivers know pedestrians treat it as a sidewalk. The arquitecture wasn't outstanding to me, but I liked the walkability of the street and also hearing French from everyone around me!

The second day, we woke up around 9. I was the last one in the hostel room from the night before and the first one to leave, so I still didn't meet the people in my room (all guys). One of them was fast asleep, and the other two woke up and started talking, so I knew they were friends. They were hardcore frat boys, so even then I didn't feel that scared because Michael had two 30 year old men in his room. That is what would scare me!

We woke up early, and I went with the girls from SLU to get breakfast. We wanted waffles but couldn't find any near our hostel, so we settled with a café nearby that was actually super cool. I got a croissant and coffee, tried to use some French (think: "Bonjour", "Merci"), and felt super proud of myself. We returned to the hostel just in time for the free city tour they offer of Brussels.

We followed the guide to the city center, in the Grand Place. The Grand Place is *absolutely incredible*! We all actually gasped when we saw it!! The whole plaza is lined with buildings covered in gold. It was really breathtaking.

Our tour started and our tour guide was super cute, but that's beside the point. He told us Brussels is the capital of the EU, which is pretty cool, and that they have the most beautiful plaza in Europe, which so far, I believe. He told us a lot about the history of the guilds that took root in Brussels, even showing us a house that Victor Hugo lived in when he was exiled. We walked past some waffles shops (they were in the more touristy area), that smelled amazing, but he told us to wait for the best waffle place.

Here are some pictures of things I saw in Brussels!
