*Technically I am writing this on May 3, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

24 hours; one city; GO.

Basically how we were upon arriving in Prague. We took an overnight bus from Budapest to Prague which was about 7 hours, and just rough overall. Looking back I'd say it's worth it so that we could spend the most time in each city, it was cheap, and we didn't have to pay for a hostel that night. However, living through it was rough. Luckily, I invested in sleeping pills so we took those to help us konk out on the way. I put in my earbuds, put my beanie over my eyes, and tried to get comfortable. I woke up a few times because we made stops so the drivers could smoke (a lot of those stops) and a few to pick people up. Everytime I heard people come on the bus I would stretch out my legs really far so that no one would sit by me. Like I said in my previous post, we were the first ones on the bus, so we all took a row to ourselves to make it more comfortable.

Finally, we arrived in Prague at the break of dawn around 6:30 AM (we had left around 11:30 PM in Budapest). In Europe, let me tell you, nothing opens before 7, maybe even before 8 or 9 or even 10. Really 9-10. So, we were planning on finding a cafe to go to while we wait for our hostel to be ready, but the bus dropped us off in front of a cafe in the bus station and we figured we would not find an open cafe in the actually city, so we went there. I don't think my eyes have ever been as bloodshot as they were that morning! I ordered a super large cappuccino, and we sat down and drank them while trying not to die. I ordered another one, the biggest size again. After about an hour and a half, we decided to go to the hostel so we could put our stuff down and get our day started. Coffee has never come in more clutch than those two coffees. It really saved the day!

We put our stuff down at the hostel, and headed to the main historic center to see the Astronomical Clock and whatever else was there. To me, Prague seemed totally enchanting. All the buildings were so colorful with red rooftops, and the occasional dark medieval tower here or there. The astronomical clock was one of the medieval structures, and it was really gorgeous. We also saw another statue in the plaza that was black and intense looking. We then decided to head towards the bridge to cross the river. All of the streets on the way were very pedestrian, with almost no cars.

The bridge was really cool and different. I liked it because it had a ton of black statues lining it, and they were pretty grotesque. Some of them were showing really violent deaths, which I had never seen in a city before. Usually cities are pretty and polite, but these were morbid and scary. I liked that! We were out so early in the morning (and a Saturday morning nonetheless) that we basically had the whole bridge to ourselves. We crossed and got to the other side, and decided to go see the famous Prague Castle, which was the #1 tourist attraction in Prague. Literally it is just a normal looking building. It honestly doesn't even look old...even though Google says it was make in the 9th century. We were all confused because we couldn't figure out if we had made it to the Castle or not, but really it was extremely normal and underwhelming! However, right past it is the St. Vitus Cathedral, and that was a classic Gothic Cathedral that was beautiful. The stained glass was breathtaking and it was very impressionable. After, we went to a Starbucks right by because it actually had amazing views of the city, no lie! We tried to figure out what to do next, but we realized we had already seen everything on the normal tourist guides to see, which was great because we were only going to be in Prague for one day and we already had done everything, but also it wasn't even noon yet and we had run out of things to do. So, we walked around that side of the river and went shopping, some people got foot therapy things (like where those tiny fish each the dead skin on your feet), and I tried to find the area of Prague known as Little Venice because of the canals. We didn't walk far enough to see that actual Little Venice, but I didn't mind to much because I wasn't exactly sure where it was either.

Crossing the bridge again, we saw a hilarious one man band playing, and he was really good! We made it back to the main busy street and got HUGE sausages with onion that were really delicious and perfect at that time. We were completely surrounded by disgusting pidgeons the whole time, and people kept throwing their buns at them so they wouldn't go away. It was entertaining but also they were so gross and some had this weird mold growing on them or boils on their feet, and honestly pidgeons are just the worst. Anyways, we also had a street performer right by doing soccer juggling tricks which was super mezmorizing, so we stayed there for a while. We made it back to the hostel to shower because we were all gross and we hadn't even checked in to the room yet, and we wanted to shower before going to the John Lennon wall to take pictures.

Finally we were about to do the last thing on our list, see the John Lennon wall. We walked over, and some people didn't know what it was so I told them it was a big wall with John Lennon's face painted and a ton of graffiti on the rest of the wall, and when we got there, idiots had already graffiti'd over his face so only basically his eyes were showing. It was really a shame, but some people were saying maybe they repaint his face over and over again, too. Anyways, we stayed there for quite some time because we all wanted pictures of ourselves, with this person, that person, with the group, etc. It was like taking prom pictures all over again. There was a guy there playing Beatles songs which was nice, and later I found out my friend Bianca actually cried while we were there! Afterwards we found a bar right next to it called the John Lennon bar, and everything there was imported from London. Considering Michael and I and a few others weren't planning on going to London this trip, we loved it! We got two different kinds of London beer, and they were actually both really really good, especially considering they were imported and not on tap or anything.

For dinner we had planned on going to a nice Italian place that was gluten free because we had two gluten free eaters with us this trip. We crossed the bridge and actually witnessed the cutest proposal on the bridge! She said yes :). We ate dinner at the restaurant, which wasn't amazing, but I wasn't complaining because they needed to put up with finding their own food all weekend because they are gluten free and it wasn't horrible. We went back to the historic plaza just in time for the hour, and there were a ton of people standing around the astronomical clock. We didn't know what was happening, so we waited, and on the hour the clock struck and a little show started. It was extremely underwhelming, haha. Tiny figurines came out and just wobbled back and forth for about a minute and then went away. It was so funny!

Then, everyone in the group wanted to go back home, but Michael and I decided since it was our only night in Prague we should make the most of it, so we went out. First we went to a jazz bar (which is a longer story why we went there that isn't interesting), and then we wandered until we found an Irish pub to go to. In Prague, the bars/pubs are all kind of underground and *everyone* smokes inside. It was kind of gross, especially because you descend into these places full of smoke, but we dealed with it. The Irish bar was **lit**, and I mean lit. There were like 5 groups of Irish bachelor parties happening there, and there was amazing live music. Michael and I met a ton of those Irish guys, and one of the groups knew who the singer was, so that was even better! Apparently he's really famous in Ireland! We stayed there pretty late and then decided to head back to the hostel. That was one of the most fun nights I've had since being abroad because of the amount of people we met and the good vibes with the live music. Live music to me really makes a difference!

The next day we had to leave, but before we did we went to the Apple Museum, which was brand new and for some reason everyone in my group wanted to go there. It basically goes through the whole history of Apple and a little about Steve Jobs' life, and they have a collection of basically every Apple computer invented. It was funny to see how far we've come in technology. Afterwards, we ate at a very touristy restaurant nearby and got sandwiches, then we left for the airport. It was a little hard to find a cab, but we eventually did!

Considering we did Budapest and Prague in the same weekend, and that they are both Eastern European cities, I'm very inclined to compare them. I absolutely loved Prague, way more than Budapest. I thought the architecture was really charming, and the city was just enchanting. They have a mix of fairy tale looks and dark medieval buildings, which is just totally unique. I also think I fell in love with the fact that we conquered that one day like no other. Considering we got there at 6:30 AM after a 7 hour janky bus ride, made it through the whole day, had one of the best nights out so far, and lived to tell the tale says something. Prague will always have a special place in my heart.
