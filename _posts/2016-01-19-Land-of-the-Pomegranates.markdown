I woke up early, showered, ate, and zipped up my new REI travel backpack, ready to head out on the bus to Granada. My backpack was *awesome*, fit a ton of stuff, and will totally work for 3 weeks abroad (Connor) as long as you rewear some clothes. I got on the bus, reading some Andalucía travel books I took with me that were left in my room from people who have stayed with Pilar in the past. I actually am really glad I took them with me because I learned a lot about Sherry (which who even knows if I like sherry, I just like to know more about wine because it's a posh topic haha), the typical tapas they serve in Andalucía, and that usually if you order a drink they will serve a tapa for free.

To be honest, I slept for 90% of the bus ride. It was 2.5 hours, then we stopped at a small café for a thirty minute break, then 2.5 hours after that to our hotel. We arrived in the center of Granada where our hotel was, and, as you can imagine being that it's in the center of the city, it. is. **AMAZING**. I was looking forward to staying in a hotel instead of a hostel because our Duke coordinators are also staying with us, so I knew we wouldn't stay in a hostel. But this place is soooo nice! Lining the streets are these classy bars that when we saw them at night, are filled with older, rich couples who are probably talking about art and life. I'm so lucky to be here!

We had around 2 hours to ourselves right after we arrived, so I ate the sandwich and apple Pilar made me, and then we walked around. Connor found a nice *bodega* to go to called Bodega Espadafor, which was a good 15 minute walk, so we figured it was perfect so we could see some of the city before we return back to the hotel for a tour. I ordered a cerveza (beer), which came with a small plate of paella made with chicken and mussels. It was delicious! I could only eat a little bit of it because I had just eaten lunch, but it was really good. For the three of us, it was 8 euros total. So around 2.5 euros each! That's a whole lunch right there!

We got back to the hotel to meet Nuria and Eva, and our tour guide Fernando. We walked along until we got to the burial ground called La Capilla Real de Granada of Queen Isabelle and King Fernando, the famous couple who reigned over Castillo (Isabelle) and Aragon (Fernando). They were the ones who backed the voyage of Christopher Columbus. All three of these people (and some others I'm about to mention) play a huge part in the history of Granada.

First Fernando showed us the architecture of the building, saying that it was built in the time between Gothic and Renaissance styles. It was cool because you can literally see the different styles in the building, there is a gothic style window with a pointed arch right next to a Renaissance style door with a fully rounded arch. The whole monument was built in about 20 years, so it's pretty amazing that the style changed just over a few of those years between the building of the window and door right next to it!

We couldn't take pictures inside, so I can't post any here. But, we went inside, and we saw the tiny "church" that was built around their monuments. It was small he said because it wasn't meant for the public, it was meant for small ceremonies. There were big monuments in between where normal people would sit and where the altar was, showing that the rulers were more than humans but less than gods. There were two monuments, one for Isabelle and Fernando, and to the left, one for Juana and Filipe. These monuments depict them sleeping on a bed with ornate animals and cherubs around them. It is made out of white marble, marble which is cold and hard like death, and white because it is a pure beginning for them in the afterlife. I especially liked Isabelle's bed because her pillows were very depressed while Fernando's weren't. That is their way of showing that she was incredibly smarter than Fernando and thus had a head heavier with intelligence (oh yeah!!). But really, she was the ruler of Castillo, while Fernando ruled Aragon. She handled all of the politics, the finances, etc., while he basically just won battles and did the brunt force of their partnership.

They had five children, the first, a girl named Isabelle, married the King of Portugal. She even had a son, but both she and her son died. The second child was a boy, who died when he was 18. So, it left her third child, Juana, to be queen when Isabelle died. Juana married the King of Belguim (I think?), and her mom died (Fernando died young), so they became rulers. Apparently they had never met before they married, but they feel madly in love, having 6 kids. However, Filipe had a lot of other lovers, and Juana kind of went crazy, shouting all the time etc, so they started to call her "Juana La Loca". That's a common name for her. However, our tour guide said that it was probably genetic because her grandmother was crazy and Juana also had a daughter who went crazy. I thought all of that history was amazing, because I never learned anything about them besides they approved Columbus's voyage to America. We got to see their crypt, and the ornate decoration of stories of Jesus and the bible behind the altar. Incredible!

After, we walked through some of the souvenir shops so they could show us the typical Granada souvenirs, which are ceramics, wood, and I actually forget the third sorry. We walked a little bit more through the streets. I asked Connor and Gaal how they thought Granada felt different than Madrid, because it was obvious that it was different but I couldn't articulate how it was different, and they said it was definitely denser and more colorful. I totally agree with that. In comparison to Madrid, Granada is a lot tighter, and its buildings are consistently taller than those in Madrid. I hesitated from thinking that at first because I naturally thought bigger cities should be denser, but in Madrid almost every corner has a plaza. The streets are wider because there's more traffic. It really does make sense that Granada is tighter. Granada is more colorful, too, like they said. Their buildings are more pink/yellow than those in Madrid. However, what is common in the south of Spain is white houses, which we saw more of on the mountain side than in the city.

We took a taxi (which was incredibly cheap) to a view point of La Alhambra, the most famous palace in Granada. It's *huge*, and its *beautiful*. We got there just in time to see the sunset, a nice rosy shade, with the Sierra Nevada mountains in the backdrop on the left along with the city of Granada on the right. It truly was a sight to see!

Nuria, Eva, and Fernando then left us, and we walked back into the city which was really quick, maybe 10-15 minutes. We decided to walk around, then get dinner. I really wanted to buy ceramics because Fernando had explained to us that typical Granada ceramics are white with blue or green decoration, blue considered classier, and when the blue is bright it's considered cheaper than when it's more grey/metallic. I went into one souvenir shop, didn't like anything because they were cheap and all bright blue, so I gave up and decided to buy stuff in Sevilla when we had more time. However, we ended up back at the exact store Fernando showed us a nice, softer blue ceramics, so I went in and decided to get something. I was going to get a small, blue plate, but decided a bigger one, although more expensive, would be better in my future life. I bought it, and am totally in love, especially because on it is drawn a pomegranate, which is the symbol of granada. Pomegranate in Spanish actually is Granada!

We then went to a place that Connor found on Trip Advisor as one of the top 10 restaurants in Grenada called El Quinteto. When we arrived, I didn't have high hopes because there were three Asian couples inside, and no Spaniards (and we had passed plenty of places with Spaniards inside). However, even if there were no Spaniards, the food was **amazing**. I got pastela moruna, which is like a Moroccan spiced chicken inside puff pastry, with powdered sugar on top. I didn't really know what it was, but I knew Granada had a lot of Moroccan flare to it, so I thought I'd give it a try. It was really good! The spices were delicious, and the whole dish was really sweet. I got some vino tinto to go with it :)

We went back to the hotel to put my plate away and charge our phones. Afterwards, we went to a place recommended to us by our tour guide Fernando for churros, called Café Fútbol. We sat outside even though it was cold and ordered one plate of churros with beer. The churros were like huge, fat, hunks of dough, but it was delicious (how can a churro not be!). Again, we didn't assume this, but the beer came with bread topped with jamón serrano and cheese. Oh, how I love jamón. We met some students there who were studying in Granada from U of I, and actually a lot of them were from the Chicago area but not exactly the NW suburbs. They recommended a bar that we could go to.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">The huge churros and cerveza!</p></center>

After we finished churros, we went to the bar, called Chupiteria69. That literally means 69 Shots. We walked in, and they had a huge menu full of shots that were all 1 euro. A study abroad students paradise!! We ordered some, but at the moment I found out that my dear Grandpa Ha had passed away. I started crying in the bar, so we left and just walked it off. We walked around Granada for a bit, then headed back to the hotel.

It was a long, long day, and it didn't end on the best note. Dealing with loss while you are gone from home is really hard, especially knowing you won't return for months. I'm glad to know that my grandpa passed peacefully, and that my mom is a strong woman who loves her dad very much and got to visit him a lot before today. Grandpa Ha, rest in peace.
