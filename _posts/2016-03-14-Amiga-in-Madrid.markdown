*Technically I am writing this on May 6, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

Woo! I get to show one of my best friends around a city of the country she lives in! When we were in Barcelona, Sara and I were talking about how Sara should come visit, not only for me but also she hasn't seen Madrid since she was a little girl. So, finally we decided on a weekend and Sara actually came! She stayed in my house, I had already asked Pilar, and since Pilar usually has two people staying here in Madrid with here it was no problem to put Sara in the other open room.

I picked up Sara from the airport and took her back to my house so she could unpack. That first night, we were going to go out to the most popular disco in Madrid called Kapital that I still hadn't been to, but since Sara had to wake up around 6:30 AM that morning, we decided to stay in and instead we watched a show called Mujeres y Hombres y vice versa that is kind of like the Bachelor but different, and it's pretty dramatic. It was the first Spanish show I actually watched a full episode of. Strangely enough, that show has an episode every single day Monday through Friday for like 2 hours... I don't know how they get that much footage!

The next day I had to wake up to go to a chat about the North of Spain because we were going there on Monday. I thought it would take an hour, and I had planned with Pilar and Sara to go to El Escorial that day because Sara wanted to see it, but the stupid chat took like 3 hours. I was soo mad because a "chat" should be at most an hour... I got back, and Pilar had decided to go to a cultural event because she didn't know where I was. She got back about an hour later, but Sara took forever to get ready (as usual), and then finally we left in Pilar's car for El Escorial. Turns out, the traffic was absolutely insane, so Pilar just dropped us off at Retiro. Sara and I took pictures at the lake, and in the Crystal Palace. We then went to Gran Via because (unknown to me) the Gran Via street and especially the metro stop is really famous in Spain. So, of course, Sara took a million pictures in front of the metro stop, and then we walked home.

That day was the day one of Gabi's plays was put on to enter in a contest, and she had told me about it for months. We went back to eat dinner and get ready to go, and what do you know, both Sara and Pilar took absolutely forever to get ready, we went to the metro, and then Sara had to buy a ticket to get on the Metro, which took forever and make us miss the metro, then by the time we finally got there the doors were closed and we couldn't go in. I felt really bad for Pilar at that moment, especially because I knew if Sara weren't there we would've made it on time. The thing is Pilar is always late and so is Sara, so together it was just awful. We went to a bar nearby to wait because Pilar's friend had seen the show, and then Sara and I left because we were going out that night.

We went to Space Monkey and met up with SLU people, saw Michael there (the first/only time he saw Sara), and had a good time. The other thing was, Sara only brought 50 euro to Madrid, FIFTY EURO, and no credit card. I have no idea why she though she could do that, but she did. AND she bought a 20 euro shirt at Brandy...that pissed me off, especially because when we were in Barcelona Sara made us take the metro all the time or go to an expensive sushi dinner, etc, but she did not give us any slack when she came to Madrid. But, whatever. I was just glad that that weekend she was in Madrid and it was then that I realized I could not travel to Paris with her!

The next day, Sara hung out with her friends who were in Madrid while I had to work on some homework. We hung out at home, and then at night we walked to Michael's to get some all you can eat sushi. That was where Sara spent her last 20 euro... great. Anyways, after that, we decided to go out in Malasaña, the cool/hipster neighborhood of Madrid. We wanted to go to a place called Ojalá that has a beach in the basement, but we had to wait a bit, so Michael and Carlee walked around while Sara and I waited outside because Sara "didn't want to walk"... Another straw. But OH WELL, we finally made it downstairs, and it was totally awesome! The whole basement was covered in sand, and there were pillows and very low seats. We all got either wine or beer and just had a good time there. It was really cool, not a place I would go to again, but nice to go once.

The next day we had the extra challenge of having 0 money to spend. We walked down Paseo de Prado, which was really cool because they closed down the street from cars so we could walk on the whole street (it reminded me of Bike the Drive), took pictures in front of the Prado, couldn't go in because Sara didn't bring her student card (ugh), but went all the way to Atocha to see the station. There's a little pool there that is just full of turtles, and we stopped and just watched the turtles sunbathing for about an hour. Atocha is famous because there's a huge indoor garden, and that day there was a bohemian market happening, so we walked around that. Everyone was selling jewelry, incense, or tapestries. Then we went upstairs to take pictures in front of the plants.

Then we went back to eat lunch. On our way back, we passed a party in the street in front of Cibeles that was an international Indian dance group with a huge speaker and they were all dancing. It was really fun to see! After lunch, we walked to Sol, then to Plaza Mayor, saw the Royal Palace and Cathedral, and then went to Templo de Debod for the sunset. Surprisingly, we made it on time! While we were sitting at Templo de Debod, we were SOOO exhausted, we could barely even get up. It was kind of ridiculous. We were so tired of walking, but we mustered the strength to go back home to eat dinner.

The next day Sara wasn't leaving until the afternoon, but I had to leave in the morning to go on my Northern Spain field trip. So, I said bye to Sara the night before. I know Sara that day went to Zara and got ice cream with Pilar. Pilar absolutely LOVED Sara. Pilar was honestly obsessed with Sara, and even once Sara suggested she put sea salt on her salmon tartar, Pilar bought it and has now put it on everything and constantly talks about how smart Sara was for suggesting it... Lol.

I liked this weekend because I got to be a tourist in my own city. I could not really stand Sara, though, although I'm glad I was in a place that I would get to spend a ton of time in anyways, and not like we were traveling together to a new city and she was ruining it. I think Sara is just really high maintenance and that just bothered me all weekend. Also, Michael was barely with us because Sara got on his nerves so badly in Barcelona from before that he didn't want to see her, so I was kind of left to deal with her alone. But anyways, it was nice to see certain things in Madrid and I got a lot of nice pictures out of it! :)
