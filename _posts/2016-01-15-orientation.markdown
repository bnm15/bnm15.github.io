Yesterday, I had orientation for a bit and I met the two guys who are in this program with me! Connor is from Williams College and is really, really nice! He's a really outgoing person, talkative, and seems to think the same of this semester as me (a break from real school, haha). Gaal is from Duke, quiet, but nice. He doesn't seem to be on the exact same page as Connor and me, but considering there's only three of us I'm sure he will hang out with us, too! We then did a quick bus tour of Madrid. My tour guide has the HARDEST accent to understand, it's not Spanish... She never pronounces her S's. Makes it hard for me to understand her which is unfortunate. She also is really old so half the time she forgets what she wanted to say. She's going to be with us all semester, but whatever! I can google the facts if I need.

Pilar cooks the BEST food. I've had a chickpea soup, this delicious thin pan fried chicken and turkey, amazing tortilla española, and swordfish. Every morning I eat scrambled eggs, fruit (banana, pineapple, mango, kiwi), freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, and espresso. She is the best. I am living like a queen!

Today I had orientation again and found out my Andalucía trip starts in Granada for one night, then we go to Sevilla for two nights. Then we are on our own! We might go to Malaga because Connor has some friends there, but that's also pretty far away (2.5 horas). Then we went to UC3M for a tour of the school with Pablo (a Duke in Madrid person) and a girl who goes to UC3M and studies biomedical engineering. After, we toured Leganés, which is the engineering campus. The buildings are really nice, the libraries are cool (although I don't like studying in libraries), and the best part is she says that when it's nice outside all of the cafés on campus start selling sangria and all the students drink sangria outside. Can I transfer here...?

Afterwards I went to the Mercado de San Miguel with Michael. We walked around a big, then went into El Corte Ingles, which is the biggest department store and overall business in Spain. They have everything, literally everything. Designer clothes, cheap clothes, kitchen supplies, a grocery store, toiletries, hiking gear, outerwear, gourmet food, street food... I mean, if you think of anything, El Corte Ingles sells it. It is quite an experience.

I was really tired when I got home, so I watched Breakfast at Tiffany's in Spanish to relax. Pilar also *loves* Audrey Hepburn like me, so we both couldn't shut up about how perfect and beautiful she was.

This is my third night going out. We went to Sol again, I met some people from University of Minnesota and SMU. So many students here, I'm almost worried about practicing my Spanish more!
