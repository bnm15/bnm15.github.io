*Technically I am writing this on June 16, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

Wow. In hindsight, Munich was one of if not the top place I visited while abroad. Here's why. Before going abroad, when we were brainstorming where we wanted to go over the semester, Germany didn't take priority in my mind. I'm not exactly sure why... maybe it's because I associate Germany with an ugly language, people who yell and drink a lot, its disturbing history of genocide, and nothing very "iconic" like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben. So, we didn't plan on making a weekend out of visiting Germany. Also, I figured I would go to Germany at some point in my future life, because it is a popular destination, and also perhaps on business as it has great engineering.

We decided to go to Munich as Michael and I were planning our spring break trip. We wanted to do Italy for sure, and we figured that Germany was so close, we could probably squeeze another country in to our endeavors abroad. We looked it up and Munich was the closest, biggest city geographically and demographically (respectively) to Italy, so that's where we decided on going. I've heard that Berlin is up and coming hip, but that it is more modern whereas Munich gives you a real German feel and really looks like Germany. Turns out that's right (at least for Munich), especially because Munich is in Bavaria, and the Bavarian culture is very identifiable and unique. They have the classic white and wooden houses on rolling hillsides with sausages and beer for breakfast, and they celebrate Oktoberfest in lederhosen. Classic.

Munich was our northern most destination, so we flew in to Munich. I went in expecting it to be the most advanced country and airport we had seen so far, and it was, however it was extremely lacking in any English signs!!!! A leftover of the supremacism, perhaps? We had to take the train from the airport to the city center so we could get to our hostel, and there were absolutely no indication of how to do that in English. Luckily, some random woman came up and helped us by selecting which tickets we needed, but then we didn't know what time it left or what platform to get on or anything because it was all in freaking German!! We went down to where the trains were, and all I knew was we had to get to some station that says "Centraal" on it or some English resembling word. So we found that, and there were a ton of people waiting for one train, so we figured it had to go into the city center. We were right, luckily, and no help to our lack of German!

We made it to the main train station, and by this time it was a little bit dark outside (we left on Thursday night). We got to the hostel, which was extremely nice. We had heard a lot about this hostel before, and it really worked out! We got free beer coupons for their bar, so after dropping our stuff off we went downstairs to claim that. Afterwards, we went to a famous beer garden that was nearby called Augustiner Keller. When we walked in the lady asked us if we were eating or not, and we were hungry so we said yes, and she took us to a side room (away from the long rows of benches :( ) to a table and gave us menus. We wanted the special, but it was out, so we ordered what ended up being possibly the best meal I ever had. Ever. It was pork knuckle, which was a huge square of pork on a bone, and I'm not kidding, the skin was the **crispiest** thing I have ever eaten in my life. It was *SO* crispy and crunchy that I don't know how they did it. Somehow it wasn't oily either, just perfectly, perfectly crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside. Ugh. I'm craving it right now!! Not to mention, it came with this giant potato dumpling, which was amazing and perfect with the pork knuckle, and also some sauerkraut. We got huge beers along with it, and because I read it was "strong beer" season in Munich (there was actually a festival for strong beer going on), we ordered that. It was a dark colored beer that tasted a little nuttier, but it wasn't bitter like an IPA.

After that, we decided to walk into the main square to see the city by night because we only had two nights in Munich. We walked and saw the main glockenspiel, the main Marienplatz Plaza, and eventually passed an Irish bar that Michael's friend had told him about. Actually, now that I think about it, we went out looking for an Irish bar because it was St. Patrick's Day!!! Woohoo! What better place to be in (aside from Ireland) on St. Patrick's Day than the *other* land of beer! This bar is popular apparently and has two sides: an Irish side and then down a hallway an Australian side. We started on the Irish side, which had an Irish band playing, and got a Guiness to start, but it was extremely crowded so we went to the other side, the Australian side, and poked around until we found a room where another, smaller band was playing and it was less crowded. We stayed there because we weren't looking to have a wild night, and it was actually hilarious. The band was AWFUL. I mean, the singer was totally wasted and he was so, so horrible it was just a riot.

We went back to the hostel after that and slept. We woke up the next morning in time to make the free walking tour of Munich. We didn't know much about the city, so we figured we'd go. We walked back down the same way we went to Marienplatz, and actually made it to a famous market I had read about called Viktualienmarkt. Our guide apparently knows a guy who owns one of the stands, and he got us a deal for a sausage and beer for 5 euro. Whaaaaat. We got a spicy sausage sandwich, and a *bottle* of beer (bottles are so fancy!!). We walked around the market talking to a girl from London, and made it back with our group. What a perfect way to start the day! Then we walked around the city a little more, and to be honest there wasn't anything totally spectacular. We saw a Church that was like the only structure to not be destroyed in WWII. There's a footprint in the back, which is the most remarkable part because there's a legend that it's the devil's footprint. The church itself wasn't ornate or anything, it was pretty simple with just white columns, but was a cool break from the overdone (beautiful) Catholic churches in Spain. We saw the Opera house, which apparently has burned out like five times, even though once they built a water tank under it just in case it burnt down again. When the tour ended, we asked the guide where the English Gardens were, and they were pretty close so we walked there. The garden (meaning beer garden) was in the middle of a huge park in the city, and there was a cool scaffolded Chinese structure in the middle of it. It's outdoor, so we grabbed our liters of beer and a pretzel and sat down in the sun to enjoy our afternoon snack. After that, we were pretty tired, so we headed back to the hostel and took a nap for a few hours.

We woke up and headed downstairs to redeem more free drink coupons at the bar (and they had a nice happy hour). We met some high school girls who were on gap years and traveling for a bit, and although I was jealous at first they clearly had no idea what they were doing, which maybe comes with a few years of age? Not sure, but I felt more comfortable with where I was at, being abroad and not taking a gap year to travel. After that, we went to the most famous beer garden in all of Munich, Hofbrauhaus. This is the biggest, best, most touristy place ever, and yet I loved it. Usually you're supposed to stay away from things that are too touristy, but this. was. AWESOME. It was huge, and packed, and so German. We seated ourselves at a table and kept flagging down our waitor to order food (meatloaf and potatoes) and started on our first liter. After finishing our food, Michael and I decided we were going to make friends with this big group of Germans beside us, because afterall, it was just Michael and me, and Hofbrauhaus closes at like midnight or some ridiculous hour! So, we actually did make friends, and it was the best time ever. Possibly of all of abroad. They were absolutely hilarious, some spoke English better than others, but we just had a ball with them. There were 4 or 5 guys and one girl, some of them were living in Munich and the others were from Hamburg, who were in town, so the Munich ones were showing them around. The girl kept calling everyone Fat Boys and Girls which she says is a term of endearment, and she kept calling me Joyce Patricia which made *everyone* crack up. We still don't know why she though Joyce Patricia was the funniest name in the world, but it was funny to see her laugh so hard.

When Hofbrauhaus was closing, they actually asked us if they wanted to go clubbing with them. We were shocked, and were like OF COURSE! So we went and walked outside, back to Marienplatz, while we waited for them to figure out where we were going. While there, the girl took some street performers guitar and started playing, it was great. Then we got into cabs and headed to the first club. The first one was called Sauna and was literally like a ski resort. It was all covered in wood inside and it was literally steaming, like they inject steam in the room. It was really cool, but Michael and I weren't feeling it, and neither were they, so we took another cab to the next club, 8 Below, which was THE BEST. Can you tell I loved Munich? Somehow we got in without being German because they're pretty strict about that. When we paid for the tickets I asked in German (only asking "$8?" because Ms. Cavers taught us the numbers in German). We got inside and the place was bumping. They play 90's/early 2000's songs, which was a total blast. It was different than the discos in Madrid because there was a huge circular bar in the middle and a stage, so it had a vibe that was less formal than the Spanish discos, but was still clearly a dance club and not a bar. We had so much fun there. At one point, Michael turned around and pointed and we saw that a speaker had **LIT ON FIRE** and people kept splashing their beer on it to put it out and finally someone came and took the speaker off the ceiling. It perfectly describes how **LIT** it was at that club. Man, it was just amazing. They played the Spice Girls, for pete's sake!!

Around 4:30 or 5, we started to head home and realized the club was right next to our hostel. How perfect was that. We were sad to leave our amazing German friends, but we had pictures to last :). Getting home so late was actually a horrible idea because we had a bus to catch (luckily right next to the hostel) at 7:00 AM. So yeah, basically you can see where this is going, we slept for about an hour, got up, shoved all our stuff in our bags, and ran to the bus station. We didn't even know where it was, and it turns out it was on the other side of the station which was huge so we had to go all the way around and quite a ways down. Luckily we did make it, and honestly, I don't even remember that well that morning. *Well* worth it. Sorry mom and dad :). On the bus ride, it wasn't that exciting because Michael and I literally slept the entire time (7 hours or so), but I have to say that at one point, I woke up as we were stopping at a McDonald's, and saw the most amazing view ever. It was also the most ironic view ever. We stopped for a McDonald's, your classic side of the road pit stop, but right behind it was the most striking Swiss Alp I'd ever seen (and, the first!!). It was gorgeous, covered in show, surrounded by only bright blue sky, and just sharp and rugged as any mountain I'd ever seen. It was absolutely a sight I will never forget. To wake up, groggy and confused, and peer outside to that natural beauty was just remarkable. And then I fell back asleep until we arrived in Venice.

SO. What's the takeaway on my trip to Munich? What started as a place that I didn't really want to go to, ended up being THE best place I went to. At the beginning I said "one of the best places", but now that I've written about it, I remember that it WAS the best. I had my best meal there. I had the best change of heart there. I met the best people there. I went to the best club there. I had the most beer there. I feel like I fully enjoyed life there more than I did in other places, or that everyone around me was just having a great time. My impressions of Germans now is that they are extremely kind, fun-loving people who are just really living life to the fullest. I actually want to learn German now, and I am shocking myself by saying that. Man. Munich, you will always have a special place in my heart. Until we meet again.
