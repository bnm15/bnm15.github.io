<center>*This post is written in submission to the <a href="http://www.tortugabackpacks.com/" target="_blank">Tortuga Backpacks</a> Study Abroad Scholarship. Thanks for such a great opportunity, Fred and Jeremy!*</center>

When I tell people I’m going to study abroad, they usually respond with, “That’s so cool that you’ll be living in Madrid!” or, “You must be excited to experience another culture!” As my departure date is getting closer, it’s becoming more and more apparent that the pressing question to answer before I leave is, “What is my definition of ‘living’ in Madrid and ‘experiencing’ another culture?” People study abroad for all sorts of reasons, but what do I want to take away from my abroad experience, besides 10 extra pounds and a few GB of photos?

From the small glimpse of abroad travel I had in Barcelona, I learned so much. I learned how to properly give *besitos*, how to cheer at a Barça game like a maniac, and how to prevent my stomach from getting hungry for dinner before 10pm. On a deeper level, I learned about the struggles Cataluña has had with the rest of Spain, and I talked for hours with my Spanish mom about her experiences through Franco’s oppressive dictatorship and the freedom that followed when it collapsed. These were issues I learned about in class before I went, but conversing first-hand added new layers to my understanding.

Now, that was just from *one week* of being abroad. Imagine how much I could learn from **four months** of this, in addition to taking Spanish culture classes alongside Spanish students and living with a host family. Learning about the perspectives and experiences of people who have lived in a culture much different than my own allows me to become more educated, accepting, and empathetic to other people, all things we need more of in this day and age. We are not solely citizens of our respective towns or countries; we have become global citizens, and as such, it is important to gain perspectives on the role we play in the world.

I hope studying abroad provides me with personal growth. Studying with the Spanish students may teach me what to appreciate in my own student life in America, or it may point out some flaws in the American system that I can work to change in my university when I return. Observing the relaxed work-life balance of my host family will hopefully provide a fresh perspective to “work to live” in contrast to the American “live to work” mentality. On the other hand, it may show me the importance of having a competitive work place that constantly strives for innovation.

I also am looking forward to learning lessons applicable to my career. I want to go into software engineering (like you, Fred!), and seeing the differences in the way the Spanish use software is essential to diversifying my understanding of global technology. I want my career to change the world, and in order to do that, I need to know a little bit more about how the world outside of America works.

I think my definition of “living” and “experiencing” another culture is never letting myself live passively. I’m so excited to absorb everything I can from my surroundings and truly be living in the moment.
