*Technically I am writing this on May 30, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

I woke up Monday morning early, grabbed my packed bag, and headed for the Metro. However, Pilar insisted that she drive me to the train station, so I went with her instead. We actually almost didn't make it because the traffic was so bad, but I got on the train *just* in time, probably three minutes before it left! I got there, expecting Nuria (the program administrator) to be really mad at me, but instead she just asked me if I knew were Connor was, and I didn't. Turns out Connor missed the train. Classic! That means he needed to find his own way of getting there on his own bill. He said he would grab the next train which wouldn't arrive until night, which would turn out to be a little big problematic, but we'll get there.

After the train ride, we arrived in Santander, and the bus was actually half an hour late, which made Nuria even more stressed out than normal. Finally it came, and we started our little tour of the city. Santander is actually a really big tourist town, but touristy for Spaniards who go there in the summer. It's right on the beach. Gaal and I got lunch on a patio facing the water, and we walked down a ways to see more before heading back to the bus. Then we all went to some palace on a jut out peninsula of the city, where some important political conferences are held. We didn't go inside, just walked around it. It was pretty, not necessarily spectacular, but had nice views of the water. Then we headed out to our remote hotel. That night we were staying in a rural cabin hotel, because that's apparently what a lot of Spaniards do. Or, at least, they all have rural houses that they go to, so they wanted us to experience that. It was a few hours southwest of the city, and our hotel was really nice considering it was rural. Gaal and I walked around the town and there were chickens and horses everywhere, we did see a school, although it was very much rural farmland. Then we went back and had some dinner, which was all traditional Spanish food and **amazing**, and this is when Connor came. He had to take the train to Santander, then find a bus to the rural town, then take a taxi to our hotel. It was quite a fiasco, but of course he was forgiven in no time because Nuria is obsessed with him.

We went to bed after dinner, and left in the morning for Altamira, a museum kind of nearby where the first trace of human drawings was ever found. This was the worst thing we did with the program, and we all agree. We went, did a workshop on throwing lances like the cavemen did in the old days, then walked around the museum for like an hour and a half that was so  pointless, then finally we were allowed in the cave, but don't get too excited, because they won't allow people in the real cave anymore, so they built a replica out of plastic that we went in to. It was such a waste of time. I would have preferred to spend more time in Bilbao, the next city we went to.

We took the bus to Bilbao, which we only went to to see the Guggenheim Museum (there's another in NYC, too). I absolutely loved this museum. It was really, really modern, had really cool sculptures outside that were unique, and there was also a huge Andy Warhol exhibit that I loved. It was a really unique museum and a refreshing site to see after seeing so much antique stuff throughout all of Europe.
