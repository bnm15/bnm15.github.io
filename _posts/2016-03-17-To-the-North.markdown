*Technically I am writing this on May 30, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

I woke up Monday morning early, grabbed my packed bag, and headed for the Metro. However, Pilar insisted that she drive me to the train station, so I went with her instead. We actually almost didn't make it because the traffic was so bad, but I got on the train *just* in time, probably three minutes before it left! I got there, expecting Nuria (the program administrator) to be really mad at me, but instead she just asked me if I knew were Connor was, and I didn't. Turns out Connor missed the train. Classic! That means he needed to find his own way of getting there on his own bill. He said he would grab the next train which wouldn't arrive until night, which would turn out to be a little big problematic, but we'll get there.

After the train ride, we arrived in Santander, and the bus was actually half an hour late, which made Nuria even more stressed out than normal. Finally it came, and we started our little tour of the city. Santander is actually a really big tourist town, but touristy for Spaniards who go there in the summer. It's right on the beach. Gaal and I got lunch on a patio facing the water, and we walked down a ways to see more before heading back to the bus. Then we all went to some palace on a jut out peninsula of the city, where some important political conferences are held. We didn't go inside, just walked around it. It was pretty, not necessarily spectacular, but had nice views of the water. Then we headed out to our remote hotel. That night we were staying in a rural cabin hotel, because that's apparently what a lot of Spaniards do. Or, at least, they all have rural houses that they go to, so they wanted us to experience that. It was a few hours southwest of the city, and our hotel was really nice considering it was rural. Gaal and I walked around the town and there were chickens and horses everywhere, we did see a school, although it was very much rural farmland. It also really looked like Scotland, with so much greenery and mountains. Our administrators told us that everyone gets surprised by that because when you think of Spain you think of the south where there are beaches and Mediterranean houses, etc. Then we went back and had some dinner, which was all traditional Spanish food and **amazing**, and this is when Connor came. He had to take the train to Santander, then find a bus to the rural town, then take a taxi to our hotel. It was quite a fiasco, but of course he was forgiven in no time because Nuria is obsessed with him.

We went to bed after dinner, and left in the morning for Altamira, a museum kind of nearby where the first trace of human drawings was ever found. This was the worst thing we did with the program, and we all agree. We went, did a workshop on throwing lances like the cavemen did in the old days, then walked around the museum for like an hour and a half that was so  pointless, then finally we were allowed in the cave, but don't get too excited, because they won't allow people in the real cave anymore, so they built a replica out of plastic that we went in to. It was such a waste of time. I would have preferred to spend more time in Bilbao, the next city we went to.

We took the bus to Bilbao, which we only went to to see the Guggenheim Museum (there's another in NYC, too). I absolutely loved this museum. It was really, really modern, had really cool sculptures outside that were unique, and there was also a huge Andy Warhol exhibit that I loved. It was a really unique museum and a refreshing site to see after seeing so much antique stuff throughout all of Europe. Bilbao was really cool to be in because, like Catalan in Barcelona, they have their own language called Basque, that is a mystery to all linguists because it doesn't stem from any other language. People think it's because the region is surrounded by mountains, so the people there developed their own language from isolation. To me, it sounds like spoken Spanish, but it looks like Chinese written with English characters. It is so interesting!

After the museum, we got back on the bus and went to our final destination, San Sebastian. San Sebastian is a really famous northern beach town of Spain. We went to our hotel, and then all of us went on a "pintxos tour", which are like little tapas that you can eat with your hands and are generally on a small piece of bread with a skewer through it. We went to two places, one modern and one traditional. They also have a special kind of sparkling white wine there, so I tried that, along with some fish pintxos, spicy shrimp, truffle and vegetable, and for dessert at the modern place I had a really good lemon cake, that was so creative. It was supposed to look like a breakfast, so the lemon was in this little pod that looked like an egg yolk (and actually you had to eat it all in one bite because it explodes in your mouth!), and then there was a cake that was made to look like toast. At the end, the guy told us to eat this little flower looking thing at the end, so we did, and it was HORRIBLE. It looked like a dandelion flower, and it was the most bitter thing ever. It makes the inside of your mouth tingle in a very bad way, and both Connor and I thought we were having an allergic reaction to the thing!

The next day, our final day, we woke up and had a walking tour with everyone. We went to the famous La Concha beach, which is shaped like a conch shell. We walked along, in the wind and rain (horrible day for the beach!), until we got to the hill on the other side. We went up on a little trolly thing to the top, and there was the best view of the whole city. You could see the whole curve of the beach, as well as the island shaped like a turtle right in the mouth of the bay. We tried to see a little sculpture called the hairbrush of the wind, but it was under construction. Then our administrators left us, so we went off to get some more pintxos for lunch, which were again fantastic, and surprisingly cheap considering how nice they were, and then we went to a park near our hotel to explore. There were a ton of peacocks at that park, just like at El Retiro in Madrid. It's so funny how peacocks just roam around at parks in Spain! We went down to the river bank, through all these trees, expecting it to be an amazing view, but it looked like we ended up in a bank where waste goes or something. Not very pretty, haha! We went back, made it to our hotel on time, and took the train back to Madrid.

I really liked going to the north of Spain because it taught me a whole new side to Spain I didn't know existed. We do commonly think of the south when we think of Spain, but it was amazing to see so much diversity in one country through this trip. We got to hit three main cities, and although I wish we were in Bilbao a little longer, it was nice to see more than just one city in the three days we were away. I can definitely see why everyone in Spain goes to the north beaches to escape the summer heat!
