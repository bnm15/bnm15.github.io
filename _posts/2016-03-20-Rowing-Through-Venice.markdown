*Technically I am writing this on June 22, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

In my opinion, Michael and I conquered Venice. We spent roughly 24 hours there, maybe a bit less for a hostel mix up. When I told other people we were only there for 24 hours, they scoffed and said Venice deserves much more time, but, to be honest, you could say that about any place, and if you're going to spend 24 hours somewhere, Venice is a pretty nice city to do it in.

We arrived around 2 PM from our bus at the very western side of the island where the buses stop. I thought we would be in walking distance to our hostel, but that really wasn't possible. When we got off the bus, there were a few guys waiting there with boats telling all of us to get on their boat. We all went. I had no idea what else to do! We took this boat ride for a few euro from the west side, through some of the canals, dropping people off where they needed to be dropped off. Of course, I had no idea which 'port' to get off on, so I watched Google Maps the entire time in order to tell when to get off. It was a great boat ride, and shockingly fell into our lap to take such a cheap boat 'tour' of the city.

We got off close to our hostel, which was in the mid-northern part of the islands. To get there we had to wind through endless alleys, some just narrow enough for one person! It was like full immersion right off the bat. Usually we get dropped off at an airport or major bus station, so we walk down the busiest streets of the city to get to where we have to go, but this time we were dropped off at a smaller, local locaiton, and had to maneuver our way through the streets.

We got to our hostel, and this is where things got sticky. The guy apparently didn't have our room ready, or something was happening, like he double booked the room. So we sat and waited for like 45 minutes because he needed his friend to call him back who owned another hostel and who was going to lend us a room there. Finally he called back, and he made it to our location in order to walk us to wherever this new room was. It was actually kind of nice because they told us a tiny bit about the city, what sticks out the most is this old looking cathedral-type building, which was actually the main hospital on the islands! So cool. So, we made it to his friend's shop, which was a tourist shop filled with Venetian masks and so on, and we dropped off our backpacks and got gelato while we waited for that guy's friend to call him. We made it all around the block and got our ice cream and then they called me to tell me they found a room and it was ready to go to. So we headed back and followed them to this new room. It was a huge apartment that the guy just bought in order to rent it out on Airbnb, but technically the deal hadn't gone through yet and no one had ever stayed there. They just let us stay there because they felt bad that we didn't have a room, and they trusted us not to mess up the place for the one night we were staying. Basically, it was awesome. It probably would have been more awesome if we were a whole group and could throw a huge rager in the apartment, but alas, we were two, but we still enjoyed it.

After we got settled down, we left to go explore the city a little bit. We were living by the fish market, so we meandered our way down, passing the Rialto bridge, which is full of shops selling classic Venetian glass or masks, etc, and heading to Piazza San Marco, the main public square. It was cool with a gorgeous Basilica that was really unique in its structure, and kind of more Venetian looking in its kind of gothic/Moorish combination that's very sultry looking (in my opinion). There were also a *million* pidgeons there, which was really funny to me to see because I remember seeing pictures of Frankie or other friends who had gone to Venice surrounded by a bunch of pidgeons, and that square is definitely where they did it. There were tons of guys walking around offering to give you crumbs to hold in order to take a picture with the pidgeons. It was interesting to me because when I saw those pictures, I had a specific thought of the context they were in, meaning what the rest of the area looked like, where exactly that plaza was, etc. And of course in real life it was much different! This plaza is right beside a main canal/river, which Michael and I then walked along. We stopped at a cafe on the way to get some spritz, which is like wine with sparkling fruit juice, and in my opinion wasn't great. We sat outside facing the passersby, and happened to catch a choir totally dressed up singing and a guy playing the electric violin. It was pretty cool!

By that time we were hungry, so I found a pasta place on Trip Advisor that was close to our apartment. We headed back there, and made it to the (tiny) restaurant just in time before their rush of reservations. In fact, they told us we had to leave by 9 in order for the reservation to be able to sit there. It was fine because it was about 8 at the time, so we took the table. We ordered glasses of red wine and our pastas. I ordered gnocchi, and Michael ordered seafood squid ink ravioli. We *finally* got our pasta (I remember I was so hungry), and IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. This was the BEST pasta I had ever had in my life, and I'm not just saying that because I was in Italy. It was just amazing. The sauce was like a creamy tomato sauce, which was rich and full of flavor. But the gnocchi, man, that gnocchi, ugh I want it now. They were so pillowy and light that it didn't seem like it was made of starchy potatoes. They were like clouds on your tongue, unlike any gnocchi I've had before, which are usually denser and heavier. Of course the portion was a European portion, and I could've eaten like 5 more bowls of it, but we paid and left and actually ended up going home early because we were exhausted, and also because we were planning on waking up a bit early because we were leaving at 12:30 PM the next day and wanted to make sure we got to see more of the city before we left.

While we were walking home, we got extremely lost. Of course we got lost in Venice, of all places, where there are a billion canals, alleys, dead ends into canals, and just curvy streets that don't make any sense. In hindsight, it was pretty comical how lost we were, but at the time it was so stressful because we just wanted to get home. Michael didn't have any cell connection, and what I had done was drop a pin where Google Maps said I was when we got to the apartment and saved it. However, Google Maps at the time must have had me in the wrong location, because when we got to the pin I dropped it definitely was not our apartment, and neither of us had written down the address. After turning into tends of dead ends (including some where guys were peeing off the side into the canals, so yes, Venice does just smell like pee), we asked our host (because I luckily had his phone number) where our house was, and he told us how to get there. Thank god!

So, we did wake up early, and we packed our stuff up and left. We made our way back down to Piazza San Marco, thinking we could get breakfast on the river, but of course, classic Europe, nothing was open because it was the ungodly hour of 8:00 AM. We did find a place that was open, and we got some coffee, which turned out to be 6 EURO FOR A FREAKING CAPPUCCINO, in the LAND of cappuccinos, so that just set me off in a bad mood. Man, what a rip off! I couldn't tell if they overcharged because we were tourists or because we sat down (in Italy it's cheaper to drink coffee at the bar standing up, and there's a charge for sitting down). But, whatever. Gotta let it go, right?

We eventually made it back to the main bridge, looking for a nice Venetian boat to ride so we could get cool Instagrams of us on gondolas. However, what people don't tell you about Venice, is that those gondola rides are 80 euro, which we definitely were not willing to spend for an Instagram. They take you around the city, and it's like a boat tour, but we didn't relaly have time and also didn't want to spend the money for that. I actually think Michael did, literally just for the picture, but I convinced him it wasn't worth it. We decided there had to be another way, so we googled it, and it turns out there's a cheap gondola ride for 2 euro that literally just goes across the canal. At this point you're probably widening whatever Venetian canal you had though of before, but no, the canal is extremely narrow and we knew the ride would probably take 10/15 seconds. So worth it!!! Turns out, these things are SO hard to find!!!! I had to google several ports, ask a tourist lady, and we almost asked a guy trying to sell us his gondola ride but decided that would be rude. Finally, just by sheer chance (I think we saw a bunch of people getting off a gondola), we found where one of these things were. We ran on before anyone else could and took pictures so fast your head would spin. Then other people got on and we had them take our picture, and before we knew it the whole ride was over. So worth it!!! Got the Insta!!

Then, we were on the other side of the river, so we decided to kind of follow it and wander around. I was hungry because I had only had a cappuccino that morning, so what do you think, I got some gelato at 10 AM. I was a very happy woman. We wandered down the street a little bit more, and passed a church with a procession of people all carrying these weird looking branches. Then we realized it was Palm Sunday! It was cool to see this happening in Italy, where Catholicism is so important. It wasn't a huge procession, but more of a local church celebrating, and it was nice to see.

We made it down further, got to another bridge that was huge, Ponte degli Scalzi. I didn't realize it but was had walked really far, and it was almost a full tour of the city. We crossed the bridge and Michael pointed out a mask store that he wanted to go in, and it was probably the coolest thing we did in Venice. We looked at all these masks, and were the only people in the store. So, the owner really drew us in, telling us about how he makes the masks, and he even was encouraging us to try them on and take pictures!!! It was funny because he would hand us a mask, and then *he* would take the camera and pose us, point us this way and that, use a mirror to make illusions, and they turned out really well. He even gave us capes to wear, and we wore traditional Venetian masks that were what they supposedly wore in the old days so everyone could have affairs on each other. It was really in depth, and I felt really lucky that he showed us around so much (also guilty because obviously with that much time spent on us, we should really buy something even though we weren't planning on it). Well, I thought about it, and I figured Stephanie would really enjoy one of these masks because she really likes costumes and dressing up for things. So, I chose a cheap-ish one that was still gorgeous (keep in mind because these are hand made they're all so expensive), and bought it. Then we could leave the store not feeling so guilty! It was perfect.

We headed back to our apartment because at this point it was time to leave. We grabbed our backpacks and started the walk to the train station on Venice that would take us to the train station where we would take the train to Florence. We walked basically the same way we just went, made it to the train station, and made it on our train to Florence.

While we did only have less than 24 hours in Venice, it was great!! We stocked that 24 hours with as much as we could, and it really worked out. Of course you could stay and see more of the city, but if you're traveling on a superficial level like we were on these short trips, then really all there was to see in Venice was the canals. It was awesome that it was a pedestrian only place, absolutely no cars (obviously). Only transportation was by boat or walking. That was cool and different, it felt almost like a controlled amusement park where everyone is just visiting or playing house or something! But really, see the canals, see the main plaza, and then there wasn't much more to do. We got our first great Italian meal, met a cool guy who makes traditional masks, and walked miles and miles of alleys and canals, and had a good time.
