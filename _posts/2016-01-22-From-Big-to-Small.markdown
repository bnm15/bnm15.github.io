Today I woke up, had breakfast in the hotel, and packed up my things to leave. We got to leave our bags at reception which was nice because we still had things to do in Sevilla and I didn't want to carry my large A bag all around the city.

We walked to the Museum of Flamenco and got a tour. The tour was like 15 minutes and let by a Spanish man who spoke perfect British English, clearly didn't want to speak Spanish to us, and rushed us out of there as if it weren't 10 AM and he had 5000 people waiting for him downstairs... But, it was for the best because there really wasn't anything to see there anyways. Afterwards, we went to the first floor to take a flamenco class!! We knew this was coming, and seeing flamenco yesterday helped rev us up. Our teacher was very elegant and beautiful, and man, you wouldn't believe how hard it was! You have to think about every part of your body! Your hips need to move a certain way, your hands, your fingers, your arms, your legs... It's insane. We had a lot of fun though, and I know they recorded us, so maybe when I get a hold of that video I'll show it to you hehe.

Then we had around 40 minutes of free time, so we got lunch even though it was like 11:00 AM and the spaniards eat lunch at about 1 or 2. We went to a tapas place right next to the one we went to yesterday. I got a bowl of sautéed spinach as well as some fried calamari, which I couldn't finish. I love fresh sea food, but a lot of it on this menu was fried! Although they say everything is fried in olive oil which apparently is way healthier for you. Who knows!!

Next we did a tour of La Catedral with Fernando. We stepped inside and it brought back a lot of memories of a cathedral I went to I'm Barcelona. It's gothic style and has a ton of little chapels lining the edges, with a huge main altar in the middle. It was beautiful and so ornate. Also, Christopher Columbus's tomb and (partial) remains are there! Fernando told us that his body kept being moved around America before, and then back to Spain, and then some other Spanish place claimed that they had the real Christopher Columbus, so there was this huge investigation started by NASA and the EU etc to check if the body in Sevilla was the right one. Well, turns out it is, partially. A lot of body parts are missing they assume from all the movement of the body from before, and also there are bones of other people in there! He said people think these museums would take one of Columbus's bones and replace it with someone else's same bone before shipping it back off.

That was the end of our tour, and the end of the field trip. Eva, Nuria, Marcos, and Fernando said goodbye. I was really sad that Fernando wouldn't be with us anymore because he was so great! He was like a nice grandfather who you feel comfortable around no matter what. But, we weren't done, because we still had a little time to climb to the top of the cathedral and get another 360 view of Sevilla, this time in daylight. It was really pretty especially because at this time the sun had finally come out. The first time since we'd been there! We basically quickly snapped some pics and made our way back down so Connor could make his train on time.

We headed back to the hotel, got our stuff, said bye to Connor, then Gaal and I went to find my bus because mine was leaving two hours earlier than his. It took me a while, and luckily I was early, because the entrance to the bus station is a tiny door on the side of a building. You'd think a bus station would be this huge open bus station, but it was a tiny door. Luckily I found it, asked other people where the bus to Ronda was, and I found it. I only waited for about 10 minutes before we boarded and then left!

I thought I would want to stay awake in order to see the view and also so I didn't miss my stop, but I ended up falling asleep albeit for twenty minutes. The countryside was very beautiful, unlike anything I've seen in America. It was more Mediterranean I think. I arrived in Ronda around 5:30, an hour earlier than I thought and 1.5 hours earlier than my Airbnb would be able to let me in! I went to the tourist office to ask if they had guided tours, and then I went to 100 Montaditos because I'm familiar with the place, and I felt a little embarrassed carrying my huge backpack like an obvious tourist. Then I watched the sun set over Puente Nuevo, which is completely insane. The view is absolutely breathtaking. Whether it's the bridge itself, the landscape, or the white houses on the sharp cliff side, it's something you can never forget.

I walked about 15/20 minutes to my Airbnb house, and waited outside for Mar's boyfriend's mom to come let me in. She came, let me in, showed me my room, and gave me keys. It occurred to me later that when I walked in she said "can you take off your shoes and wear some slippers?" And I said "no no no!!", because I thought she had said "do you want to wear slippers?" And I was fine so I said no to be polite... Oops. She did give me a kind of weird look!

I tried to figure out what to do, whether to wait for Mar and Alex to get there and see if they wanted to go to dinner, or just go alone. I read a post on Trip Advisor about eating dinner alone to pump myself up (people telling stories about how they were afraid to eat alone but it turned out okay). I decided it was a little early for dinner and I was energetic, so I walked around the city a bit. I was actually shocked at how many people were there. I feel like Ronda is a tiny, tiny town, but SO many people were outside! It must have been everyone in the city!

I walked down the main shopping street, and saw some places I may go to later. I circled back and ended up just walking for a while down narrow neighborhood streets. It was nice because I could tell it was classic "White Village" of Spain style.

Then I decided to get dinner closer to home, so I wouldn't have to walk so far later. Also, a lot of the Trip Advisor (Trip Advisor is huge for Europe, way bigger than Yelp), recommendations for dinner were right next to their house. I walked by the place I walked to go a few times to see if I could see an open table for myself, but it was packed with people standing at the bar. Then I saw they had another space across the street for seats and bigger parties that was emptier. That seemed better to me, so I went there, called Bodega San Francisco. I said down and was glad to see a soccer game on the TV to keep me busy while I ate alone. I ordered a salmon roll that was delish, and a steak mini sandwich which was also delish!! The best part? They were ONE euro each!!! I read on Trip Advisor that some people liked to get dessert when they eat alone to make it feel more like an experience than an embarrassment, so that's what I did. I didn't understand what everything on the dessert menu was, so I asked the family next to me for help. They explained what I needed to know, and I asked the waiter for a recommendation, so I got something called Cocina de Cielo, which means cooked from the sky. It was like a flan, I tried asking how it was different than flan and they felt very strongly that it was but really to me it was flan. I was really good though!

I spent a good hour and a half in that place, and went back to my Airbnb house. Alex answered the door, and welcomed me in. We decided to talk in Spanish, and I told him I need to practice. He told me that him and Mar actually own a Spanish school in Ronda for tourists and other people that move here to learn Spanish, and it sounded really cool. They do regular classes as well as more activity-type lessons like cooking classes or hikes in order to teach Spanish. They are young and energetic, and so kind! I met Mar a little later because she was taking a shower. She taught Spanish in Washington for two years, then she met Alex and they lived in Germany for a little bit, then moved to Ronda. Mar lived in Madrid for a few years (on the street that DIM is on!) and Alex is actually from Madrid. They said they don't really get students in their house, but they were super excited. They gave me a whole ton of guides and maps and recommendations of things to do in Ronda. It's totally perfect! Then we put on a movie, The Fabulous Baker Boys, which we are all falling asleep during right now haha. I feel like there's too much to do here! I want to do all of these hikes, wine tasting, bull stadium, other historic monuments, etc, all before the sun goes down. I'm glad I have 1.5 days of sunlight left here!! I think I'm really going to love it.
