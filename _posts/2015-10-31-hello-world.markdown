Of course, as a computer science nerd, I had to start off my blog in the traditional manner. Welcome to my travel, lifestyle, inspiration, whatever else it should be, blog. I’m starting this site in order to capture the experiences and lessons I learn while I am abroad, and hopefully encourage others to conquer each day in full. I don’t really have a plan at this point, except to attempt to chronicle each day.

I am starting this blog as a sophomore at Duke University, sitting in my crappy Central Campus apartment (any current Dukie will know what I mean). I’m studying electrical and computer engineering and computer science. Chicago is where I call home, but Durham is quickly becoming just as comforting. I’m normal, same as you. I’m unique, same as you. My uniqueness is my desire to travel the world and meet as many people as I can. To start accomplishing this, I’m studying abroad in Madrid, Spain, for Spring 2016, and Seoul, Korea, for Fall 2016.

The extent of my travel experience…hmm…Well, the furthest I’ve traveled is to Barcelona, Spain, on a one week exchange with my high school AP Spanish class. That kick started my internal need to travel because I learned so much and I left the country craving more. I’ve traveled to a few US cities, but overall this upcoming year 2016 is going to be nuts.

So what is Tale du Jour going to bring? Here’s what I’m hoping:

* Regular updates on my adventures, both spectacular and mundane
* My recommendations from my experiences
* Advice for study abroad, including all the mistakes I make along the way

In the end, I’m hoping to create a memory book for myself when I’m old and reminiscing and impact any readers like yourself that are looking to learn from everything the world has to offer.
