*Technically I am writing this on June 29, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

The reason I titled this "Florence, Whoops" was because in hindsight we didn't really do all the things you 'should' do in Florence mostly because we slept through all of that stuff. But, I mean, if we were that exhausted it must have been necessary. Also, Florence wasn't like Rome where I feel bad about missing out on monuments because it was more of living the Tuscan lifestyle kind of a place.

We arrived to Florence by train, and the train station was conveniently located in the middle of the city. We walked to our Airbnb right after getting off the train, which was across the river and across from the main downtown city area. We walked by the really beautiful Basilica di Santa Maria Novella, which gave us our first taste of the Tuscan architecture. We made it across the river and walked one behind the other to our Airbnb on almost nonexistant sidewalks that lined teeny tiny streets. I remember being really struck by just how Tuscan it all felt and looked. The buildings were dark yellow and there was deep green landscape all around. It looked like all those Tuscan themed kitchen decorations you see.

We made it to our Airbnb, which was *so* cute and *so* nice. It was a little loft with a small kitchen table and couch in the first area, a futon and TV to the right, and above (accessible by a ladder that hangs flush to the wall that you pull out to get up) is the bed. The bathroom was a separate room, and one where the shower head is just there on the wall, not separate from the toilet or sink or anything, just a curtain, so I knew that bathroom was going to be a lake once either of us showered in it. It was such a charming little place with a bunch of cats that lived in the apartment next door that would always hang out outside and we could see from our windows.

As far as I can recall, we didn't do much that night. We walked around our neighborhood a tiny bit and came across a pop up shop that was so cute, it looked like Free People was hosting it. Of course, everything was really expensive, so I decided not to get anything. On our way to the Airbnb we had passed this small wine bar/delicatessen called Il Santino because we wanted a little snack and some fine Tuscan wine. I knew Chianti was right near Florence, so I knew I was going to get a Chianti there. And, what do you know, they had two kinds of Chianti! I decided to get the cheaper one because the wine was really expensive (6 or 7 euro for a glass, which is probably normal or even cheap in America). We also wanted to be fancy so we ordered a cheese plate with it. Oolala. The place was extremely tiny, I'm talking they had four tables for two people each. We were lucky that there was a table open, and we got there just in time!

The waitor served us the Chianti, and oh man, we freaked out. That glass of Chianti is definitely the best wine I've ever had in my life (which, granted, isn't very full of wine experiences, but still!). It tasted so earthy to me, like more organic than sugary cheap wines, and I loved that when you swallowed it exploded in your nose, kind of like a burning sensation but not burning, just a real kickback. Man, when I had that Chianti, all I could think of was how good it would be with some human liver and fava beans. ;) Then our cheese came out, and our knowledgable waitor told us the order in which to eat the cheeses, mild to strong, and there was also a sweet, whole grain mustard dip for the cheese along with some bread on the side. I think I liked one of the two stronger cheeses, because they had more flavor, although the first two were definitely smooth. The cheese was just so good and we felt so fancy, that was a great experience. If Michael and I were on our 'honeymoon', that was definitely the most romantic point of it all.

Next, we looked up the best pizza in Florence, and to our amazement it was on our side of the river, right near our place! So, of course we went, and we both ordered just plain margarita pizza and ate it there with a bottle of their wine. That pizza. Was. So. Good. It was pure heaven. The pieces of mozzarella were bubbly and so fresh and the basil was amazing and the crust was just PERFECT. I want that pizza right now!! We both ate half the pizza and saved the other half (because we could!) for another day. Our plan, actually, because we were living in an Airbnb was to buy groceries and cook there so we could save some money on food. So, we went back, put the pizza in the fridge, and went to bed.

The next day was a pretty productive day. We woke up and went to the grocery store to get some breakfast and supplies for the week. We got some croissants, wine, and decided to get pasta somewhere else, like at the main market, for dinner. We went back and showered, then went out to hit up the leather market!

It was a little bit rainy, but we beared with it. On our way to the famous Florence leather market, we passed the main Duomo and Baptistry area, which are the most iconic parts of the city. They were absolutely stunning. I had never seen architecture like that! I think the actual shape of the building would be pretty typical, but it's covered in dark evergreen and light pink detailing which is unique and wonderful. Contrasting with the burnt copper color of the dome, it was truly a sight to see! I convinced Michael to step inside because it's free to go inside the Duomo. I'm glad I did that, because we didn't have another chance to go inside (and we actually didn't see it again). The inside was pretty, less attractive than the outside, and simpler, which I appreciated. We could catch a slight glimpse of the fresco on the dome, which people say you can see better if you climb the Duomo.

After that, we went to the leather market to get some goods for the families (you're welcome!). It was like a huge flea market stretching for one or two streets. Bargaining is necessary here, and all of the vendors are foreign (usually Middle Eastern) so there was no language barrier. I laughed when I saw the first stand because a wallet Josh had given me after his trip to Italy was there, the exact one! I still use it! We walked along, looking at various things and trying to get an idea of what we wanted to buy. We ended up buying our things from the end of the street. At one place, we both haggled together to get some wallets for our brothers, which turned out well and the guy gave us boxes. Then we spent quite some time at another stand looking at purses. I wasn't sure which one to get mom, and I also wanted one, which took a little bit for me to decide. Finally, we haggled him down, probably not as much as we could have, but we were satisfied for our discounts. We were also impressed because we read that you can ask them to get a lighter and hold a flame to the leather to make sure it's real because real leather doesn't burn, which I thought was stupid and who would ever do that. But when we were there, the guy actually did it himself for us, which was mesmerizing to watch that flame do nothing to the purses.

The stalls line the streets outside a huge building which is a main marketplace of Florence. They mostly sell groceries or prepared food in there, so we went inside planning on getting our pasta and lunch. We came across a stall that sold these pasta sauces that I had seen all over the place, and it really is just a bag of some herbs and ingredients, all dry. The instructions were in Italian, but it seemed like you just throw in some pasta water and it turns into a sauce, which it didn't seem like that. So, I asked one of the vendors how to make the sauce, and he told me, "I'm from Italy, I don't speak English!! Italian!!", which I found hilarious, so I started to use my Spanish to talk to him. This actually had always been a dream of mine, to converse with someone in different languages where each one understands the other, and that's exactly what we did. Italian and Spanish are close enough to understand, even if you don't speak the other one, and I knew that, so I really took advantage of the situation. I was so proud of myself. So in the end, it turns out that's exactly what you do, just add some water, and I was still skeptical so I didn't actually buy any, hehe.

We walked over to another stall that was selling some dried pasta and we bought black linguini. We couldn't really find any fresh sauce to buy, so we figured we could just buy it at the grocery store. Then we went in search for lunch, and decided on a pasta place that made pasta to order (granted, the pasta was frozen). I got their special of the day, which was cheese ravioli with olives in marinara sauce. It was delicious, and just like Sara had told me before, any place in Italy, no matter how 'bad' it looks, serves great food. And she's right! Before we left, we went to the big wine stand and bought the cheapest yet nicest bottle of Chianti we could find, and a wine opener. We were satisfied to say the least.

We walked back to the Airbnb to drop our stuff off because at this point we had giant bags with us. We were also exhausted. So we went back and decided to take a nap for a bit, which turned into a lot of a nap, meaning Michael slept for like over 4 hours. He told me he had a headache and it was sinus related and he always has to sleep it off, but I didn't know that, so I was a little peeved. We were in Florence and could be doing so much! So that afternoon was pretty much gone.

That evening we hiked up to the Piazzale Michelangelo, which was on our side of the river, and was a huge plaza where everyone sits on the steps, drinks wine, and looks over the city. We went just in time for sunset and met up with two of Michael's friends, Sydney and Claire, who we actually would be hanging out with for a bit in Italy. We sat, took some pictures, and drank some of our grocery store wine (which turned out to be carbonated...not really a fan!). We stayed for maybe an hour, watched the sun go down, and then headed back to our place to make some pasta. On the way back we stopped in a small shop to grab some pasta sauce, and for whatever reason decided on pesto.

I cooked up the pasta and added the pesto, and even that meal was so good! The pasta was really good, and the pesto was just normal jarred pesto. We also opened up the bottle of Chianti, which was just as marvelous as we had hoped. We had plans to meet up with our friend Colton who was spending spring break with his mom, so we tried finding a bar to go to. Michael brought up one called the Joshua Tree, so we went there, but turns out they had a happy hour special ending at like 10, and it was 9:30, so we actually sprinted there to get there on time. Out of breath and ready for a drink, I ordered the Sicilian beer because it seemed Italian. I actually didn't like it at all. The bartender said it was like Blue Moon, but this beer was like straight up orange flavor, and not the good kind. While we were having our first drink, we waited for Colton and his mom to come. The place was small and not very crowded, but I don't think we were really looking for a wild night at that point. They came and we all ordered this kind of Murphy's Irish beer, and that one was way better. It tasted like a straight up cappuccino in beer form. It had the coffee flavor of Guiness, but almost more so. It was delish. We talked actually for a long time, and I think we had another round or two of drinks (oops), and planned out our next morning. Colton and his mom planned on waking up really early to get in line to climb the Duomo and the Bell Tower, and then also go to the Uffizi, which is the museum where David is. We agreed to meet early, I think around 8, and said bye and went home to sleep.

So, the next morning, we woke up bright and early and got in line. Just kidding. I woke up, yelled at Michael like a million times to get up, which he didn't, so I just went back to bed because I was frustrated and figured Michael could be the responsible one for once and wake *me* up. He didn't. We woke up around 12:30, completely wasting the morning and also meaning we wouldn't be climbing the Duomo or the Bell Tower, and also wouldn't go to the museum because lines at that point in the day would just render them not worth it. I was mad, for sure, but had to deal with it and moved on. While I showered, Michael went out to find a present for his grandma, and then I met up with him on the Ponte Vecchio, which is the most famous and crowded bridge of Florence because it has a ton of shops on it. The shops were actually a lot cooler than I thought. Most of them sold really nice looking jewelry, and the shops themselves were like tiny houses lining the bridge sides. Pretty unique for a bridge! Just across the bridge, on the downtown side, there was a tie shop that Michael found that was small but completely lined with all different types of ties. It was fun just to be in there and look at all the different colors and patterns. They also had a deal going, and both Michael and I wanted to buy ties for our families, so we took advantage and bought some there. It was totally a great purchase!

We were talking to Colton and his mom and decided to meet at the Piazza della Signoria. Right at the entrance we came up on to the plaza was a gelato shop with the most gorgeous heaps and piles of gelato, so we had to stop in and get some. We both got it on a cone that time, and it was absolutely delicious, but what gelato isn't? We found Colton and his mom and decided to eat lunch with them at a sandwich place they had found the day before. It was just around the corner, and it actually was a really famous sandwich shop in Florence, known for their fresh meats and breads. Colton's mom said to just ask them to make you whatever sandwich they want to, so that's what I did, and I got this huge, honking sandwich that was spilling over with fresh roast beef, truffle spread, and argula. The fresh focaccia was to die for, and it was totally worth the wait! We sat down on the curb outside to devour our sandwiches, which actually took a while, and then went back to the plaza to wait for their other friends, Hannah and Maggie to come.

We sat on some steps of the plaza, which had two important statues. One was an exact replica of David, so I didn't feel as bad about missing the Uffizi. The statue was HUGE. I mean, ginormous. I now understand why it's such a work of art. I mean, the thing is completely monstrous and the details and proportions are so lifelike that it doesn't look like it's made of rock at all. It actually stands where the real David used to stand, but apparently someone throw a chair out of the window of the building behind it and it took off his hand or something, so they moved it inside and put a replica there instead. There also is a statue of Neptune surrounded by a fountain. Behind where we were sitting were a few statues that were of pretty awful, morbid scenes, which Colton and his mom explained to us because they had downloaded the Rick Steves app and listened to some of his tours of Florence.

We waited and waited, waited probably 1.5-2 hours for Hannah and Maggie to come. Finally, they came, and I was already antsy at wasting more of my day, and you could tell Colton's mom was, too, and when they finally got there, the first thing they said was, "Oh hey, yeah we're gonna go get lunch, so when should we meet up with you?" Wow, yeah they made us wait that long and then told us that they were going to get lunch. So we said we'd meet up later, and then Colton's mom went to the leather market and us three went to find wherever they were eating lunch at because I guess at that point we had no other plans. We found them at a pizza place, and thus convened a shocking conversation to me. Apparently, Hannah and Maggie (who had taken a leave of absence and was taking online courses for the semester, was in Madrid on the 90 day visa-less travel agreement, and living in a hotel), **hated** Madrid. They rambled on and on about how it was absolutely the worst city ever and how they would kill themselves if they ever had to go back there. It was pretty dramatic, and I, who love Madrid, was kind of offended. But that meal was over soon enough, and we all decided to head to the Michelangelo Plaza again to watch the sunset.

We all bought some wine on the way, and enjoyed conversation and the really pretty cotton candy colored sky over the gorgeous skyline of Florence. Afterwards, Michael and I invited them over along with Claire and Sydney, but beforehand we grabbed pizza again from the amazing pizza place. We brought it back to our place because we were so close and the restaurant was really crowded. I opened my box and it was this lump of just dough, and I was like...wow they messed up my pizza? What is this? Ugh. And then I realized I ordered a calzone. It was written like calzzonni or something, so I thought it was just a flavor of pizza, but I realized it was a literal calzone. I really felt like Ben from Parks and Rec there. My calzone wasn't as good as the pizza, because it was just like eating bread with a ton of melted cheese, but it was good enough. The rest of the people were planning on going out that night, but I knew that we had to wake up early to go to Cinque Terre the next day, which we had bought the night before. So, I wasn't in the mood to go out and didn't want to. They did buy a bottle of limoncello which we all tried, and it was like drinking a liquified lemon head, the big kind that's sweeter, not the small sour ones. It was sickeningly sweet! Definitely not made to be taken in shots. They were all blasting music and being so loud for so long, I was annoyed because I wanted to go to bed and I also began to get paranoid about causing too much noise for the neighbors, but they went out and I immediately went to bed.

The next day, we woke up in time to walk to the bus going to Cinque Terre. And so that adventure begins!

Florence, although we slept through so much of it, was absolutely gorgeous. If I were married and I wanted to take a trip with my husband, I for sure would pick somewhere in Tuscany. The landscape is so pretty, they have such good food and wine, and it just feels like the quintessential old-time Italy. It was in Florence that I had the best pizza and best glass of wine EVER, and got to see absolutely unique architecture that I didn't see even remotely in the rest of Europe. Florence was beautiful and great, and I need to go back immediately.
