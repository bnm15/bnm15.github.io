This was our last group trip, meaning the last trip a lot of the friend group would be traveling together (I will be taking another trip to Paris, but this was it for most people!). I was really excited because this weekend was a long weekend. I had just finished two out of four of my classes, and had no class on Monday because of a Spanish holiday. We left Thursday night for Lisbon and would get back to Madrid on Monday morning.

When we got to Lisbon, my first thought was that it felt a lot like LA. There were a ton of palm trees everywhere and it was sunny and I could just see the ocean on our taxi ride over. Our taxi driver was super nice, telling us about the green wine in Portugal and about the neighborhoods to go out in, where to eat, etc.

Our hostel was not the nicest I’ve been to, but it was good because they had free pancake breakfasts every morning and a 5 euro dinner (basically all you can eat and drink), which is an insane price! We got to the hostel our first night around 8, unpacked, ate dinner at the hostel, and decided to go on the pub crawl.

They took us around Barrio Alto which is the famous cool neighborhood of Lisbon with no traffic and densely packed with bars and restaurants. Everyone basically would go inside, get a drink, and then go outside and talk to everyone on the streets. It was really cool, and we met a ton of people from the hostel who were all really, really nice. We went to a disco called Place, which was a ton of fun and they played a good mix of American and Spanish music.

The next day we got up and met two girls at breakfast who were going to the beach, so we decided to join them. We ended up taking a train 40 minutes out to get to Cascais, a beach on the Atlantic coast (because Lisbon is on a river coast/bay). We bought snacks at a super market beforehand and were at the beach from noon until basically 7 PM. We all got super sunburnt, but it was so nice to be at the beach and take a nap on the sand.

We went home, showered, ate at the hostel, and did the pub crawl again. They change up the bars and clubs every night to get people to do the pub crawl more than once, although for us it’s really worth it because it’s 13 euro with all the drinks and the club entrance, which is insane. This time we didn’t enjoy the bars as much but the disco, was, INSANE. It was THE coolest disco I’ve ever been to. It’s called Urban Beach and was on the beach, there were a ton of stand up lights outside as you walk in, and then you get in and there’s a circular bar and a ton of windows looking at the ocean. The music was really EDM, which I loved, and then all of a sudden a door opened and we noticed there was a HUGE room right next to that, with the coolest decorations. There were lounges on the sides but in the middle there were a ton of lights hanging from the ceiling that went to the beat of the music, and in one other corner there were a bunch of hanging lanterns. It was just a really modern, techno, super fun disco and I absolutely loved it.

The next day we decided to go surfing at the same beach because that girl we were with had connections with a company that would give us two hours of lessons for only 20 euro. We got there on time and put our body suits on. Our instructor was insanely good looking, so all of us were swooning over him, but anyways, surfing is really hard! It took me a while to get it but finally I was able to stand up a few times and it was really fun. The waves were tiny, but perfect for learning how to surf. Hannah actually ended up twisting her knee at the end, so she was injured the rest of the weekend, but it didn’t affect her walking too much. We stayed on the beach for a little after that, taking a nap because we were exhausted from surfing. We took the train back to Lisbon and walked around the city for a bit because we hadn’t even seen the main plazas, just gone to the beach. The main plaza of Lisbon reminded me a lot of Venice, actually.

Lisbon in general is really similar to San Francisco, and I’m pretty sure they’re sister cities. Lisbon has a copy of the Golden Gate Bridge that honestly looks exactly the same, there are a ton of hills to climb, and they have a cable car system. However the buildings themselves are very fisherman village in that they’re very worn on the outside. I really loved the charm of Lisbon, and their main street (that would be the Mag Mile) was covered in trees. Another cool thing I noticed, although we never went to one, was that were would be little kiosks around selling beer and wine and a ton of chairs out, so you could just go up to the kiosk order a beer and sit down with your friends and chat. It was a very casual way to spend time outside. Even though we didn’t get to see a lot of the city of Lisbon, we all fell in love with the lifestyle and the people who were SO nice.

That night we decided to eat dinner out, so we went to a new market that has about 20 different vendors lining the warehouse and long tables in the middle. It was perfect because we were a group of 12, so it’s hard to figure out one place to eat that everyone will like and a place that will have a table for 12. I got a dish that was really good of cod with caramelized onions and chickpea mousse. Portugal obviously has really good fish, and it did not disappoint. It was soo delicious! Other people got sushi, sandwiches, pizza, etc. Later we went back to the hostel and spent a lot of time in our room playing music and games and talking. We decided all to go out together, although I knew this wouldn’t work out because the past two nights only four of us went out at all because the others were sick or tired. We tried, going to the main street called Pink Street to see what was up, and it was super super crowded to everyone decided to go home. Five of us stayed, decided to go to Barrio Alto for one drink, so we went, got McDonald’s, and then went back to the hostel at around 1:30. Unfortunately I knew that would be our last night and I was hoping everyone would rally and have a great night but it didn’t happen!

The next day we woke up and went to a market near our hostel that was outdoor and with a great view of the city. We got kebabs at a stand and ate them outside, ending with the traditional pastel de nata which is basically like creme brûlée inside a pastry cup. Then we headed to the train station to go to Sintra, the gem of Lisbon, where the famous colorful palace and ancient castle are. That was about 40 minutes, and then we walked to the center of town and got on tuk tuks to the top of the mountain where the palace was. We took a ton of pictures there because it was really colorful and the architecture was unique. We spent all day there, went back to the city center, and got a snack. We finally had green wine which was a sparkling white wine from the Green region of Portugal, and it was yummy! We also got ham, olives, cheese, and green beans. Then we headed back to the hostel to shower and ate dinner there. No one wanted to go out because we had to get up at 4:30 AM the next day, so we went to bed early.

I really loved Lisbon because the beaches were amazing and it was so fun and relaxing to hang out there, and because the nightlife was INSANE and so much fun. There’s no disco like Urban Beach in Madrid! I would definitely definitely go back to Lisbon.
