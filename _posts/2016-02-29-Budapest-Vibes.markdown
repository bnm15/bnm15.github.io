*Technically I am writing this on May 3, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

This is part 1 of 2 of this weekend trip! This weekend was SLU's "winter break", so they had Thursday off of school. When I bought my tickets for this trip, I decided I was going to skip class on Thursday so I could go with them and make the most out of it, especially because I technically have two free skip days before I get penalized. However, it turns out that the week before we left I found out my teacher had a conference the whole next week, so we didn't have class on Thursday anyway! I was so happy, especially that I didn't plan around a class we didn't even end up having.

We landed in Budapest super late on our 30 euro one-way flight on Wizzair. We were supposed to have a car from the hostel pick us up, but we couldn't find the driver, so we stood there for a while waiting for someone to come before we figured out that they did hold a sign with one of our names on it, but it was misspelled by one letter so no one figured it out. Our group this trip was the biggest I had traveled with - 10 people, and some of them I hadn't met before. Finally we made it to our hostel. Budapest looked really run out and kind of outskirt-y, but in a really charming way. It was hard to tell anyways because it was night time.

Our hotel was in an apartment building second floor... I'm not sure how they are allowed to have a hostel there because normally hostels are really loud, but I guess it works for them! We decided to try to go out that night, to a rune bar, which are bars made out of abandoned warehouses and typical in Budapest. There was one close to our hostel, so we braved the cold and walked there. Once we got inside, we walked in and the bouncers forced us to check our coats, which none of us wanted to do because we didn't want to pay. Not to mention, the money in Hungary is called forint, and not all of us had a ton of forint to spend, so we decided to ditch it and leave.

The next day we went on a walking tour of the city. We had such high hopes because our last tour guide in Brussels was so much fun and amazing, but it turns out we had an older guy with a weird accent and he was just a little strange. But, we went on it anyways. By this time, our group was 14 because we met up with other SLU people staying in the same hostel, and there were other people on the tour, so we barely could hear any history of the city. He took us to the Opera House, the main Basilica, where actually the right hand of the first King of Hungary is (literally his hand, we saw it). One thing we did learn is the Budapest is actually two cities: Buda and Pest, Buda is on the west side of the river and is more historic and luxurious while Pest is on the east side and is the more common place of businesses and people. We then passed the Parliamente, which is an AMAZINGLY gorgeous building. It is so intricate and pretty, I was not expecting that. On our way throughout this tour, our guide kept stopping at building he said are his favorites, and none of us were that impressed because usually they were grey stone buildings with little detail... That seemed to be the style of the city from what I saw.

I asked the tour guide if we could stop to get mulled wine, so we went to a market that was recently redone and really cute. They had typical Hungarian food, but none of us were hungry, so we asked a wine place to make us mulled wine. It was really good, a little spicy because they put chili in it, but it was good nonetheless. Afterwards, he tried to take us across the bridge to Buda, but by then it had started raining really hard and it was ICE cold rain, so we asked him if we could just stop there (not to mention all the other people in the group had already left the tour). He continued blabbering on for a while, and finally let us go. We were so cold we knew we couldn't make it back to the hostel without freezing, so we went to a restaurant on the way.

It was actually a really good choice! We all got goulash, and our table also got an appetizer with sausage, meat, and duck liver (which everyone freaked out about!). People got drinks they had always wanted to try, whether it was cider, Irish coffee, or in my case a famous Hungarian wine called Vill√°ny wine, it's red, and it was the best wine I had had up until that point. It had more layers of flavor to it than I had ever tasted before, it was sooo good.

We went back to the hostel to warm up, and people all of a sudden (because we were so many) could not decide what to do. We had planned on going to the baths, but some people wanted to go in the morning, others wanted to see a Jewish Temple in the city instead, etc. In the end, we all made the decision just to go to the baths, and we were all on board at that point.

We went to the biggest and probably most famous bath in Budapest called Szechenyi Thermal Bath, which was in the opposite direction of the rest of the city. We walked past Heroes' Square on the way and saw a huge ice skating rink. Budapest just seemed really full of life!

We got to the bath, changed, and RAN in because it was so cold, and WOWOWOOW was the bath AMAZING or what!?!? The water was warm, it was HUGE, and you are surrounded by ancient looking columns and statues and it was just beautiful. There was a whirlpool in the middle which was fun, and we all decided to get out and run to the other bath on the other side because we had all gotten used to the water by then. What do you know, but that water was even warmer!! It worked out perfectly that we were getting cold in the first one and moved to the second. We all just relaxed and honestly got to know each other better, because not everyone knew who everyone was. Then some of us went inside, because there were baths in there too, which were also really luxurious and seemed like pictures of olden days. They were marked with temperatures, so we decided to go in the warm one, dip really quickly into the 16 degree Celcius bath, and then back to the warm one because we read that was really good for you. You do not know how hard it is to go into a 16 degree C bath...It took my breath away and it feels like icicles are pricking your body! But after you get back in the hot bath it's so worth it! We did that a few times, and then we found a really hot sauna that smelled like eukalyptus and had nice relaxing lights. It was silent in there, so we didn't stay to long. Right before we left to go back outside, we found a fountain full of shaved ice... so of course, we made a ton of snowballs to take out and throw at our friends who had stayed outside. We left the baths after about 2 hours, which was enough for all of us, especially because we wanted to get dinner and go on a pub crawl. I have to say, the baths so far were my best experience of being abroad. It was absolutely amazing!

So, on our way back we got kebobs at a place right next to our hostel. It was something like 900 forint, which is really about 3 euro, which was an amazing deal because those things were delicious. We went inside and got ready for the pub crawl while listening to music and having wine in our room. We went to the meeting point and met our leader, who was American and was leading the pub crawl for the first time. The other girl was more experienced, and she was actually a Korean from New York who was living in Budapest but moving to Seoul soon. Anyways, we started the pub crawl at the first bar where there were drinking games, and everyone kind of lost it. I am pretty sure we all made it to the second bar, which was more full of regular people, but by the time we had to move to the third everyone lost each other. Michael and I had a string of hilarious texts that we sent to each other while we were desperate to find everyone. After the third bar, everyone left and went back to the hostel in their own groups because we were all lost and definitely not making it to the club. So, yeah, our first pub crawl experience and no one made it to the end. We honestly don't even think the leader made it to the end because he was just as into it as all of us were... BUT we had fun anyways.

The next day we went to that Jewish Temple to please our friend Colton who is Jewish, and some of us walked around that area instead because we didn't want to pay to get in. Then we all met up together again and decided we wanted to eat on the Danube River for lunch, preferrably on a boat. We found one that seemed perfect, and it actually was. It was an older 50 styles boat, and we sat on the deck outside although we were enclosed by glass windows which was great because it was cold. Everyone ordered something they wanted, most of us got mojitos (my first!), and I specifically ordered paprika chicken with egg salad because I knew paprika was a famous Hungarian ingredient. I'd say my meal was decent, not amazing, but good enough. Definitely worth it to be on the river and have a gorgeous view of the bridge and of Buda! Not to mention, the whole meal was about 3300 forint, which is a little over 10 euro. Budapest is so cheap!

Next we walked across the river to Buda for the first time. Luckily, that day it was really sunny and nice. We climbed up the hill and got to see the Buda Castle, the view to the west, and the Parliament across the river to the east. We got mulled wine up there too and just chilled and watched the sun set. We got dinner (kebobs again), packed up our stuff, and headed to the bus station to go to Prague. It was really hard to find the station, but we eventually did, and as we were the first ones on we all spread out and took up two chairs which was ideal for sleeping. It was going to be a tough 7 hour ride for sure!

Overall, Budapest did not live up to the expectations that everyone set for me. A lot of people told me it was the best city they went to in Europe, but while I was there, I appreciated the different style and culture, but it wasn't extraordinarily beautiful. However, it could also be because it was rainy and cold most of the time we were there, so that may bias me. I did really love the baths though, like I said, one of the best experiences of abroad!
