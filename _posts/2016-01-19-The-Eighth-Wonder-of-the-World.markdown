I woke up today at 7, ate breakfast in the hotel, and we were ready to go by 8:15. We went all day to see La Alhambra, a huge palace on a mountain in Granada, which basically started the city of Granada. It was built by the Moors, starting out as a fortress and growing into the palace for the king and its own small city, in a sense. It started being build in the 13th century and finished in the late 15th century. Well, in this post, I'm going to let some pictures speak for themselves, mostly.

First thing we did was see a traditional Arabic bath that the people would use before church so their minds could be more open. It's not for cleaning, just for relaxing. Basically people would fill up pitchers with water, go to the side, sit there, and just close their eyes and drip the water on themselves. There were steaming bowls of herbs and bright ceramic tiles on the wall so they could feel the most relaxed. I imagine it as a public sauna.

A little farther was what I understand as where the kings were supposed to live after Fernando and Isabelle took over Granada, although no kings actually lived here.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Me standing in the center of the king's quarters. When you were exactly in the center, your voice would echo like crazy, although no one else could hear it!</p></center>

From there, we entered the Moorish palace, which was huge and took about 1.5 to 2 hours to walk through. Here are some pictures of the beautiful decorations and architecture built for the kings.

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/ornate.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Ornate decorated "plaster"-like material. This normally lined the upper half of the walls.</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/beautifuldoor.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">A beautiful door! You can see here all the styles, carved, dark wood, painted ceramic tiles from the floor to a few feet up, and carved plaster from there to the ceiling</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/woodceiling.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">This was a classic combo, the plaster and a wooden ceiling. So ornate!</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/columns.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">This was the patio outside the men and women's bedrooms. Every patio was lined with covered walkways so people could keep dry when it rained.</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/starceiling.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">The star was very common in the design patterns</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/wall.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Another beautiful wall</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/kingceiling.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">I am pretty sure this was the ceiling in the king's bedroom. His room didn't have windows down below so that no one could murder him.</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/megarden.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Me, showing you to my garden patio</p></center>

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/alhambra/reflection.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">A lot of the architecture here used reflection in water to magnify the importance of the building, kind, and/or empire. In this case, it's me!</p></center>

We climbed to the top of a guard tower in the oldest part of La Alhambra, the military base. The views from there were *insane*! 360 view of Granada!

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Me in front of the gorgeous Granada view</p></center>

Lastly, we toured the architect's house. The architects of La Alhambra built houses for themselves so they could live near their work, and of course, they were gorgeous. They had amazing views of La Alhambra, which I imagine they would wake up every morning, smile at their own work, and pat themselves on the back for a job well done!

We went back to our hotel area to eat lunch with Connor, Gaal, Eva, Nuria, and Fernando. We ate a ton of appetizers, including mini clams, fish croquetas, fried eggplant sticks, and calamari. I remember when I had the calamari I thought it was **sooo** amazing, and I figured out that it's because it was cooked with butter. Everything I eat here is made with olive oil, so it was totally incredible to eat butter for the first time in a long time! I didn't realize how good it was! The entree I got was pulpo a la brasa. I don't know what that means, but I knew pulpo was octopus. It came out as this *huge* octopus leg, and I was so scared to eat it. However, it was amaaaaaazing!! Whatever sauce they cooked it in was absolutely delicious. No longer afraid of huge octopus legs!

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">My huge octopus leg!</p></center>

We got back on the bus and made our way to Sevilla, around a 3 hour trip. We were all exhausted and totally passed out until we got there. We did a quick tour around Sevilla in the bus, of course I never knew where we were, but it was pretty. It seems like it looks a lot older than Granada and Madrid. I'm sure that means it has more character. We'll have to see tomorrow!
