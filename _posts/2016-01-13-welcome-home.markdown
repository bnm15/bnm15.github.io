I get off the plane and have to walk a very long metaphorical mile just to get to baggage. I stand at the wrong baggage claim for too long, which actually pays off in the end when I find out where my real baggage claim is and walk up just in time to see my suitcase come down the chute. I exit the gate, confusedly looking for Pilar, my host mom, who I hoped was carrying a sign with my name or had received a picture of me and knew who to look for. I stood there for a little, maybe 10 minutes, emailed her, and then right away she found me. I had hoped she would know some English so I could get off on an easy start (haven't truly spoken Spanish since senior year of high school, maybe a little second semester freshman year of college), but no, I was wrong. She doesn't speak English at all, which will pay off in the long run, hopefully.

I struggled along with my broken Spanish, not always understanding what she was saying but nodding along anyways. It was difficult to seem super excited because I was so tired from the plane ride, and I didn't always understand what she said, but I got along fine. She drove around the city a little, hoping to get me acquainted although I never once knew where I was. The city sure is beautiful, however. Even the smallest, most insignificant buildings are beautiful works of art.

We arrived home and she fed me a breakfast of eggs, fruit, freshly squeezed grape juice, and coffee. I talked to her daughter, Gabriella, for a bit, and then I took a shower and got myself situated and unpacked. A few hours later, she cooked me a delicious lunch of mussles, shrimp, salmon with honey glazed onions (so good), and salad. She stuffed me to the brim! I then took a 3 hour nap because I was so exhausted and could not go on.

When I woke up, Pilar excitedly told me we should go get some coffee and go shopping at Zara! We went to a beautiful café where I got café con leche, she got tea, and we both had little lemon tarts that she said were especially Spanish. It was so rich and good! We went to Zara and looked at their sale dresses. Pilar and I both bought black ones for only 19 euros! A steal compared to how expensive Zara in the US is.

After, we took the bus to El Círculo de Bellas Artes to see a presentation of a famous Spanish director, Pedro Almodóvar. There were hundreds of people in line, but Pilar just walked up to the front and they let her in. A VIP experience! There was some time before the talk, so she took me up to the roof top to see views of Madrid at night and we took a picture up there. It was a really cool looking bar, so I'm hoping to return there later!

We went to the presentation, which was hard for me to understand both because he didn't annunciate and he spoke really fast. I basically didn't understand anything that was going on. But it was cool nonetheless, especially because so many people wanted to be there. Nacho even told me the event was VIP only, so I almost feel guilty for taking a seat! Afterwards, we took the metro home.

Honestly, I thought I wasn't going to go out at night, against my friend Michaels' insistence because I was so tired. However, that three hour nap perfectly revved me up and got me on Spanish time. I ate a quick sauteéd chicken with salad (olives, avocado, tomatoes) and pineapple for dessert, then said goodbye to Pilar and Gabriella before I took the Metro to Sol. I met Michael and two of his friends before going to The Dubliners, where I stayed for about an hour. A lot of us (SLU friends included) then went to O'Connell's for the rest of the night. We met a couple from the UK, the girl from Manchester and the boy from Lancaster. They were so sociable and nice... We talked to them for about an hour. Michael and I took a taxi home (me first because I'm closer, then Michael) around 2:30 AM. I am the perfect amount of tired to go to bed. It feels like how 2:30 AM would feel at home.

While I was out, meeting Michael's friends and spending time with one of my best friends, I realized just how completely crazy I am about Madrid, even though I've only been here for less than 24 hours!! I CANNOT wait to explore more of the city, get to know more people here, and just overall expand my horizons to a place I never thought they could go.

<b>Spanish level:</b> Hard to keep up with natural speakers, including my host mom. When I got off the plane I was almost like a mute, just nodding my head when I thought it was appropriate. After a few hours, I opened up and became more comfortable in my Spanish and talked a lot until my fatigue got the best of me and I clammed up again. Speaking English with Michael and his friends was definitely a huge relief!
