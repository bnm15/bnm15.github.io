This weekend I explored the city a ton, although mostly in the afternoon because I woke up at noon on Saturday and 1:00 PM on Sunday. Oops!

On Saturday, I met a girl named Laura Cabezas with Gaal (from Duke). She goes to Universidad Carlos III and she just returned from a year at the University of Washington. She said that when she was there she wishes there were students to show her around, so she volunteered herself to show us around, which was really nice. She is really pretty and fashionable, so I definitely am going to try to become better friends with her!

We started near Gran Via, worked our way down to Sol and Plaza Mayor. We drank tinto de verano on the plaza, which is some red wine with Fanta limón. It's SO good!! She says it's a typical Spanish drink. We walked down Gran Vía, Paseo de la Castellana, and Calle de Serrano. We finished at the northwest side of el Parque de Buen Retiro, where we waited for Connor, who was too late to see Laura because she left to go study.

Gaal, Connor, and I ate at a place that Laura said was good. I got a ham and cheese sandwich, which I thought was going to be like a true Spanish bocadillo, but it was a sad, grilled cheese sandwich. However, I was starving so it tasted good to me! I went from there back to my house because I was tired and wanted to rest a little bit. On my way, I saw this cool mural on the Metro wall for Retiro.

When I got home, Gabriella (my Spanish sister), said she was also really tired, so we watched Singing in the Rain together (English wit Spanish subtitles). I had never seen it, and it's actually a really good movie! If you can't tell, Gabriella and her mom love the arts and musicals. It's fun to enjoy it with them!

I stayed in Saturday night because I was too tired not to.

On Sunday, I woke up late, like I said earlier. I ate some eggs and fruit with Gabriella while Pilar was cooking a paella. I knew today she had told me to invite Michael and she invited her nieces to come eat paella, so I asked her what time Michael should come. She said 2:00, but it was already 1:00 and I had thought it was for dinner! I told her that was fine, but Michael probably couldn't come (because he wasn't awake either). She said that she would wait for dinner then because her nieces couldn't come anymore (studying), so she held off for us! So nice!

Today I actually walked through Retiro with Michael. There's a famously photographed lake there where you can take rowboats out, which I will probably do in the spring. It was pretty and we sat by the lake for a bit.

Pilar had told me to visit the Crystal Palace, so we found it and took some pictures. We met two students, one originally from India, one from Malaysia, who study in Boston, are on a semester abroad in Valencia with the Berkley School of Music, and just visiting Madrid for the weekend. So much traveling! They were nice though, and told us that paella originated in Valencia and that there are streets lined with orange trees that are so beautiful in the spring, so of course it made us want to add Valencia to our list of places to go!

We went inside, and it was an art exhibit for a guy named Dahn Vō. The exhibit was called, "Banish the faceless/Reward your grace". This was SO confusing to me. It consisting of a bunch of hanging mammoth bones, a hanging replica of Jesus, and a half cut off marble face in a box on the ground. Extremely bizarre. It was like Lovely Bones in real life... The best part is that the half bust in a box on the ground was entitled:
**\*Warning, very graphic writing about to take place**\*

<center>*"Your mother sucks socks in hell"*</center>

Yes, and along with some other parts of it were a letter from a guy who was supposed to be executed the next day, so his quotes were very graphic, including lots of 'f' words, 'c' words, calling your parents bad names, etc. *VERY WEIRD*.

There was another palace right next to that one called Palacio de Velázquez. There was an art exhibit in there as well, although this one was more tame. It was by the artist Andrzej Wróblewski, who died unfortunately at the age of 29, and did most of his work in the 50's. He uses a lot of contradiction in his paintings, often painting the front and back of a canvas in order to say something. They say his work focuses on the post WWII mentality, disheartened and broken, but also hopeful for a new future. One of his most famous front/back works is this here, where on one side is a conductor driving people into a better future (his most famous, I think) called "Blue Chauffeur", and on the other side a painting called "Liquidation of the Ghetto".

We ventured through the park some more, and came up on a peacock. Yes, a PEACOCK. It was insane! A peacock just roaming around in real life! Of course I took a ton of pictures, it was awesome.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Beautiful peacock!</p></center>

After walking a bit more, we realized there were tens of peacocks in the park! Females and males! It was incredible! I can't believe they're just there, walking around. I've never seen one before. It was really marvellous!

We also saw this really creepy jester thing on top of some prison... Not sure what this was, but would like to find out one day.

We then went to 100 Montaditos (100 little sandwiches) because on Sundays and Wednesdays everything is only 1 euro! I got a tiny montadito that just had jamón and olive oil on it. I cannot tell you how much I love Spanish ham. We also got tinto de verano again, because 100 Montaditos always had it! This place is constantly talked about by everyone: Laura, Gabriella, my professors at Duke, everyone. They are located *everywhere* and it's so cheap for students, so it's a very popular place to go.

We tried looking for a scarf for Michael at Chamberí, but came up short, so we went back to my place to research about weekend trips. Then Pilar made paella and served us amazing red wine from the north of Spain. It was **amazing**! The paella had shrimp, calamari, chicken, and mussels in it. Very delicious!

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Best Spanish dish ever!</p></center>

Michael left, and I research on where I should stay this upcoming weekend after our trip to Sevilla. I was trying to look for Ronda, but there aren't a lot of places to stay there, so I'm thinking Cadíz would be fun! A lot of people online say it's a great place.

Now I am off to bed, ready for another day of orientation tomorrow. Chau!
