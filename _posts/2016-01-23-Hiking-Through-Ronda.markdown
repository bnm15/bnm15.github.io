I set my alarm today for 10:30 AM, but ended up waking up at 9:00, which was fine with me, because that's all the more Ronda to see! I took a shower and started looking over all the Ronda tourist guides they gave me, specifically the one with several hiking trails shown. I also looked at the Instagram for Experience Local and saw they are constantly posting pictures from Ronda Sweet Bakery, so I knew I had to go there for breakfast.

The bakery was actually right around the corner from my Airbnb, and when I got there I ordered a croissant and cafe con leche. I actually botched it up because I thought you order and pay at the counter and pick up your food yourself, like an American cafe, but the lady kept getting so confused when I asked her at the counter and handed her my coins. Later I realized that this cafe had waitor service, where you sit, they take your order, and you wait until the end to pay. I apologized and laugh before I left, and she said she didn't mind. Oh, all the faux pas I've made.

Next, I read in the guide for the hiking trail that I should get a tourist pass from the tourist office, which lets you in to a lot of places for a cheap price. So I walked that way, then decided it wasn't worth it, so I went back to my place to shed some layers because it was getting pretty warm and I knew I would be hiking.

After I changed, I headed south to the start of the trail. When I got there, right away there was a wild horse just standing there eating grass. Literally right in the middle of the path! I didn't know if it was the type of wild horse that would hurt me or is very used to humans or whatever, so I just kind of waited and luckily it moved off to the side so I could get by.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Alright horse...that's enough!</p></center>

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">More horsies!</p></center>

The trail is called Ermita de la Virgen de la Cabeza. It's about 5 km long, 2.5 there and 2.5 back. It looped around from the south out to the east of the city, so you got the full view of Ronda with all the vineyards and orchards in between. It was a really easy hike, and I really loved it. It gave such a good view of the city and nature, both of which are very important to Ronda. And luckily it was pretty short and straight forward, so I never got lost!

Next I went back to check where the next route that I could hike was. I asked Mar for lunch recommendations with a view, and she told me to go to Casa Clemente and asked for the menu del día. I went there, it was west of the city more at the bottom of the gorge. They didn't have outdoor seating yet because it's still the winter, and their windows are super tiny, so it wasn't exactly the view I had wanted, but when researching restaurants with views of the bridge and gorge they seemed expensive and solely for tourists. So I was happy with this place and the fact that I had to ask for the menu del día because she said when they see tourists they just give them a tapas menu! I asked the waitor to give me his recommendations for the two plates. I got a soup that was very similar to gazpacho with crumbled bacon and hard boiled egg on top. It was really good, especially because I was so hot from walking around in the heat. My second course was like a breakfast skillet. It had a ton of potatoes, eggs, sausages, and mushrooms. It was really yummy, but way too big! In the end, that meal and my glass of wine was only 7.50 euros, and I didn't even see my wine on the receipt! I honestly think they felt bad that I was eating alone and just staring out the window... haha. Works for me!

Next I found the trail I wanted to do the most, called Molinos del Tajo. This one goes to the bottom of Puente Nuevo, which is where a lot of people love to take pictures. I started at the very north (it finishes with Puente Nuevo in the south) so that I would save the best for last. I also knew this was a gorge route, which means you go down first, then up at the very end, which is the hardest type of hike because mentally it's just hard to climb all the way back up when you feel like you're done seeing everything you want to see.

This trail curves around the side of a mountain that encircles the area called Los Molinos. Then it meanders through the orchards and vineyards that make up the substance of Los Molinos. I saw a lot of vineyards and farms - roosters are *everywhere*! Then it starts climing back up to Puente Nuevo, which is a tough climb, but like I said, it's easier when you're staring at the exact thing you did this route for! I took a ton of pictures throughout my hike, and found little nooks and crannies here and there either of views of the bridge or of the countryside. I occassionally stopped to rest and look at the views, which were perfect breaks when I was too tired.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">This is the moment I looked up and was like...Oh crap I have to climb back up!</p></center>

I tried to follow a few more trails around the bridge, but ultimately decided I was done with this and didn't think going to the very bottom of the bridge was necessary. So, I climbed all the way back up, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and patted myself on the back for a job well done. I finished just a few hours before sunset, and I knew I wanted to sit on Mar's third floor terrance for that, so I made it back home just in time.

I'm glad I chose to do these hiking routes for a number of reasons. One, I was totally sick of doing touristy things like seeing a catedral or doing a tour of the bull fighting stadium, especially because they're things you want to care about but in 5 years you just won't a ton. Hiking is different in that it's physically rewarding, and the views and pictures you take along the way will be special forever because you had a reason to stop and take that picture. Two, Ronda is literally a village on a cliffside, and these trails were totally perfect to take advantage of seeing every angle of how it's set up. Ronda is also small enough to where you can see a lot of it through a few, short hikes, which was perfect for the amount of time I am here. Third, hiking is very easy if not better to do alone, and since I am alone, it worked out well. I could go at my own pace, take all the pictures I wanted, choose my own path, and I didn't have to be afraid of being alone (like I am when I eat meals) because everyone hikes alone. All in all, I absolutely love what I did today.

I went back to the Airbnb to rest, because I was dead tired. I walked about 10 miles of trails! I decided to watch the sunset on their third floor terrace, because why not?! Their terrace is beautiful! I stayed up there, slowly freezing my butt off, until I deemed that I had seen the greatest the sunset could offer. I went to put my coat on and ask Mar where she recommends I go for dinner. She named three places, I looked all of them up on Trip Advisor, and I decided on this place called Entre Vinos because all of them seemed great, but this one served only wine from Ronda, from no where else. I thought that was really cool, especially because I wasn't going to get the chance to go to a wine tasting here.

I left the house around 7:45, which was perfect because the place opened at 8:00. Can you imagine if all the restaurant in the US opened at 8:00 PM? Sheesh! Anyways, I got there about 8:05 PM, which I thought was great because online everyone said this place is so popular that it fills up right away, and everyone recommended to get there exactly at 8. Well, I got there, and the garage door was half-way closed, with no one inside, so I was like ugh, it must open at a later time. There was a church around the corner, so I sat on a bench there until 8:15 because I thought maybe it would open then. Well, I got there at 8:15 and it was **packed**. I mean, when I went inside, people were walking out because they couldn't sit or stand anywhere! This was one of those tiny bar places, not a full sit down restaurant, which explains how it can get so packed. This is one of those times, though, I felt okay being alone because I just snuck in on the side of the bar!

I ordered what I wanted, and surprisingly it coincided with what everyone on Trip Advisor thought was the best! I got a plate of jamón iberico, some goat cheese (which came on a bread type thing), and squid ink pasta with aioli. I'm sure the waitress was like, three people could probably eat what you ordered, but when I'm in Spain I determine the portions by the prices. Everything there was less than 2 euros, so I figured three tapas would work out. For me, considering how hungry I was after walking all those miles, the amount I ate was great! And I ordered two glasses of wine (I had to! They were from Ronda!), called Tagus and Aguilares Joven. The first one I ordered because I thought the bottle was the second nicest (I couldn't read the name on my favorite looking bottle), and the second I ordered because some Spaniards around me kept ordering it, so of course I had to. They actually tasted different both from each other and from different red wines that I've had before, but I couldn't tell you how!

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Tagus is second from the right, and my favorite Aguilares Joven is the last on the right!</p></center>

Just to let you know, all this food (three tapas and two cups of wine for one person) cost me 9.50 euros. *Not to mention* the quality of the food here was insane. It wasn't like I was getting street food. In the US, I estimate that meal to cost $30.

Enough about that. Who knew I'd end up writing novels for each of these blog posts. I walked home, tried to figure out why pictures weren't showing up in my previous posts, and went to bed. Good night Ronda!
