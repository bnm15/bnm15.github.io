*(The feature photo is definitely too morbid for this post, but bear with me)*

The semester is starting to wrap up, and emotionally I'm contradictory in every way. I dread the end of the semester as much as I yearn for it to come. I dream of being at home, but I am terrified of leaving Durham for a year. It seems like thinking about speeding up or slowing down time always makes it do the opposite, and I'm left in the dust without accomplishing what I wanted.

Starting this semester, I knew it would be my last months in Durham before I left it for a full year. People say I'm crazy because I will only be three years at Duke, and I started to believe them. I fervently made lists of "Things to do in Durham" before I leave as if I would never return again. The list of restaurants left unchecked is long, and as I can almost count the number of days I'll have left here on two hands, I'm freaking out about *experiencing everything*.

"I only left campus a few times this year."

"I never made it to Watt's Grocery, everyone's favorite restaurant."

"What if our basketball team is national champs again, and I miss it?!"

The list goes on and on. It's hard for me to take because I see these things as both rational and irrational. On one hand, people do say college is the best four years of their lives. Do I really want to miss out on a whole year of that? That's a whole year of relationship building and school spirit that I will miss out on, will it put me behind? Will I graduate Duke having no meaningful relationships, no special ties to the school? Do people not want to bother being my friend because they don't want to invest the time to get to know someone new?

On the other hand, studying abroad has been my dream since middle school. I knew I would travel, and even before I came to Duke I had my notorious "Four Year Plan" created in Excel, holding every class I would take for my time at Duke. Somehow, even being an engineer, it has all worked out. I am going to Spain. My petition for Korea is completed early and in great shape. There hasn't been a kink in the road, which makes me elated. I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for abroad, but I know in my heart that it's something I need to do. This urge is what has given me the strength to stand up to those people who judge my choice to leave the comfortable for so long.

What I need to remember is Durham will be waiting for me when I get back. I have amazing friends who will be waiting for me when I get back. People say what they want about what I'm doing, but it's not going to affect their lives at all, just mine, and I know this is what I want. I'm not sure what the right answer is in terms of time: should I want it to go by quickly and just *get to Spain NOW*, or should I want it to slow down as much as possible, elongating my time with my friends and beloved Durham that I feel like I just got settled in with?

Maybe there is no answer. At least, no right answer. But what am I do to? What are my actionables? I seriously have no idea.

I guess all I can do is experience everything as it comes, not passing judgement on the speed of time. It's okay to be both excited and anxious. The world won't stop because of me, but it also won't leave me behind.
