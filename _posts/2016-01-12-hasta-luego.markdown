I arrived at O'Hare two hours before my flight thinking I'd have time to kick back, watch Les Mis, do a BBG workout, maybe watch another movie... But the time here has actually flown. I just got accepted on the Yelp Elite squad, which is a huge deal to me because I've been furiously writing reviews this break to get it! I don't know if I'll attend any of the private events, but it's worth a shot! It can't hurt to get free food and drink in Madrid, and meet new people who also love food :).

I've been inundated with emails lately from Craig's List postings to find an apartment in Seattle, emails from my future roommate in Seattle, emails from students at UC3M who want to help me out, emails from my host mom making sure my travel goes well... Friends from home message me well wishes and friends in Madrid message me to get my butt over there. I've been trying to answer all of this along with spending as much time with my family as I can. Even though I will see them again in May (the same as if I were going back to Duke), something about this feels different. Maybe it's because I'm going to a new place and am really scared of not having the comfort of American culture and knowing my family is not that far away. I also think it's because I know when I come back in May, it's only for about a week and then I'll be off to Seattle. When I get back from that, I'll be home for about a week and then I'm off to Korea. I chose to do these things for myself, but I didn't realize before how much I would be affected by leaving the people I love! Sounds silly, but it's true.

Moving forward, I am SO, SO EXCITED. I mean, who gets to go to Europe, "study", and travel to many countries? I'm so lucky to be able to do this. I'm so looking forward to taking advantage of every moment I get. My biggest anxiety right now is speaking Spanish. I'm going to be greeted by my host mom when I land, and right from the get go I'll be thrown into another language and another culture. The culture I don't mind so much, it's the language I'm extremely worried about. I hope I know enough to keep up, but I'm also afraid it will take me a while to get on track and I will get tired of not communicating as well as I want. But, we will see how it goes!

I'm glad the flight to Europe is long. It let's us decompress, think about what's going to happen, and it's like an 8 hour pep talk to yourself. You can relax, calm your nerves, and take a grand ol' time adjusting yourself mentally for what is about to come.

There are so many kids here that are clearly going to study abroad (I'm pretty sure my whole flight is just college kids), and it's making me excited seeing everyone nervous and antsy together. This is going to be a real doozy, but it's a doozy I can't wait to take on.
