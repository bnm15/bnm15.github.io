When in Seattle, it's really easy to want to travel to the nearby Northwestern cities Portland and Vancouver. Before coming here, I was nervous I would not be able to find anyone who wanted to travel on a weekend with me, but it was actually really easy and it turns out a lot of people have the same idea!

I bought bus tickets for Anushree, Mina, and myself during the first week here in Seattle. They venmo'd me back, obviously, but it was just easier because I found the bus tickets. We left the hotel open ended because we invited more people to come on our intern Facebook page, but in the end it was just us three girls, plus Anushree's friend who lives in San Diego and would come up to Seattle to come with us to Portland. Later on, Anushree booked a hotel room through Google perks funny enough.

Saturday morning we woke up bright and early, planning on leaving around 6:30 to catch a bus downtown to the bus station, because our bus was leaving at 7:30 AM. I woke up at 6, dressed, grabbed my backpack that I had packed the night before, and went downstairs. Anushree and Andrea were just starting to cook oatmeal, and that's when I knew we wouldn't make our bus. What do you know, after several warnings that we needed to leave, they were not ready and we did not make our bus. So I looked up the next one, which would get us to the station just before our bus left. We walked farther down to that stop, and did end up making it on time. We met Mina at the station.

We got on the Greyhound bus, which was pretty gross, but it wasn't too packed and we sat together. I slept for about an hour and listened to podcasts for the rest of the four hour drive. We got to Portland, and it ended up being delayed about half an hour because we had to take a bunch of detours for the Rose Festival parade that was going on downtown. We had no idea that we would be there for the weekend of the parade! Portland is known as the City of Roses, so it was cool to see. It's the second biggest rose parade after Pasadena's.

I was the only one who had looked up stuff to do, so I had planned out the day and lead us to the Saturday Market area. This weekend market is huge in Portland, and a perfect thing to do as it was close to the bus station, our hotel wouldn't be ready yet, and full of interesting things that would occupy us.

On the way, we crossed the parade, and ended up in front of Voodoo Donuts, the most famous donut shop possibly ever, and originating in Portland. So, being the smart girls we are, we decided to wait in the Voodoo line while watching the parade. It was perfect! The line went by quickly because we were entertained the whole time! We finally made it inside, and luckily we had looked up all the tens of donuts on their website because their menu doesn't describe any of them (there are too many, and I'm sure it would take forever for people to choose if they read each and every one of the descriptions). I ordered the classic Voodoo donut (a chocolate longjohn shape with arms, decorated as a voodoo doll with a face and a pretzel sticking out of it, and filled with raspberry jam), as well as another donut called Old Dirty Bastard which was a ring donut with chocolate, oreos, and peanut butter. They were *huge* and let me tell you, the BEST donuts EVER. Man, they were sooo good. I loved that they were a higher quality sugary donut, without being so artisanal that I wasted time trying to taste the "Himalayan pink peppercorn" like in some gourmet donut shops. In other words, it was the ultimate guilty pleasure, and didn't require any mental capacity for foodie critique because it was just loaded with junk. Mindless deliciousness, my favorite.

We ate those donuts while walking around the Saturday market. I almost bought a tote bag, because I'm debating buying a tote bag from everywhere I go, but ended up not buying it because I figure I don't need a million tote bags. I already have two from Madrid and that seems like enough. I changed my mind to think maybe I buy tote bags from places that I live in, so I could buy one from Seattle, Chicago, and later Seoul. That would keep the number low but still show my travels :)

The craft show was filled with a lot of gorgeous jewelry that I tried to resist every time, with some difficulty. We grabbed some lunch at a Kathmandu food truck, serving dumplings, lentils, brown rice, and salad. It was so good! I miss lentils, because I ate them so often in Spain. We sat beside the river that cuts the city in half north to south and ate our lunches.

Afterward, I had told them that Stumptown, a very famous Northwestern coffee chain, originated in Portland (although there are a couple in Seattle and Google actually serves their roasts!), and their nearby headquarters offered free coffee tastings at 3 Monday through Saturday. Everyone was in to coffee, so we made our way across the river and to that area. The southeast area of the city was definitely less crowded, the buildings were lower, it seemed more like offices were there instead of being filled of retail shops, but there definitely were hidden gem cafes there. We found the Stumptown headquarters, and entered into a room full of people. I was worried it was too many, but they seemed to know what they're doing.

There was a guy and a girl worker, the guy was the one who was leading us in the tasting. The process we went through is the same process professional importers, exporters, cafes, corporate business, etc. taste test and judge new coffees or their own coffees that they provide. The way it worked is they laid out five types of coffees, each one ground in three cups, so there were fifteen cups in total. We went around in a line, first just smelling the dry grounds in the cup. They just wanted us to get first impressions. Next, he filled each of them with hot water, and we had to go around and smell them again (the grounds steeping in the water), within the four minutes of brewing. It was kind of a challenge with so many people, but we made it around. This was to soldify our opinions of each of the roasts. After that, 15 of us were able to grab spoons and 'break the seal' of the ground that started to float on top of the water. That just meant patting the top of the surface with the back of the spoon to push those grounds to the bottom. When that film breaks, a small, short burst of scents comes out, so you had to get your face really close. I was able to do it, luckily! After that was when we got to do the taste testing. We each had spoons and a cup for spitting. We went around, grabbed a little on our spoon, slurped it as loudly as we could into our mouth, kind of chewed it for a bit, and then spit it into the cup. For each of these rounds, we did two cups of the three for each roast, because the first cup is considered a "palette cleanser" from the last coffee. They spit the coffee, although it's not necessary, because not only do they not want to drink that much coffee (and it's not even prepared in a great way because all of the roasts are supposed to be on an equal playing field and stripped down plain), but also because they don't want to consume so much caffeine, which made a lot of sense! After that round of tasting, we chose our favorites, and all held up our hands with the number of our favorites. Amazingly, each of the five had just about the same number of votes. It was then that the guy told us stories of each of the roasts. Before then, we had no idea where they came from, what 'notes' we were supposed to be tasting, or anything about them at all, because we weren't supposed to be biased in any way. I really liked that, because I would totally fall for the biases. My absolute favorite ended up being an Ethiopian coffee, and my second favorite a Sumatra. He said those two were the craziest ones that just have crazy, crazy flavors. It's true, the first three were kind of flat to me, and those two were more dynamic, which I liked.

In between some of these rounds, he explained coffee to us. I learned that coffees grown at higher elevations are more expensive (so "supposedly" better, although it's obviously up to your own taste) because at higher altitudes the coffee plants struggle more, and therefore put more nutrients in less fruit, as opposed to plants at lower altitudes that just have the life and have less nutrients because they produce so many fruits. Therefore, the more nutrient, less frequent fruits are more complex. He did give us two roasts, both from Columbia, one from higher altitude, one from lower altitude, and I definitely liked the higher altitude, but it could have been due to some other reasons. They didn't have the same notes and weren't produced in the same region, so I can't determine the real cause and effect there.

Overall, I absolutely loved the tasting. It was free, we learned a lot, especially about our own tastes, it was a unique experience, and I am so proud that I found that for us to do. Good job Brenna.

After that, we went north to our hotel, and stopped in a cafe on the way just to check it out because it looked cool. It was a cafe that also made its own chocolate in shop, and Andrea bought a bar of 100% chocolate, meaning no sugar, which was really intriguing. I didn't try any, but I dont' think I would want to, anyway. That's a little too dark for me!

We got to our hotel, checked in, and chilled out, looking for a place to eat dinner later. We decided on a sushi place, that, what do you know, was right next to Voodoo. We had the hotel shuttle take us there, and we got a nice view of the restaurant upstairs, directly over the sushi chefs. We actually spent most of the dinner just watching them make sushi. I really liked the sushi I got, and it was cheap, and Mina and I split a green tea mochi for dessert. It wasn't my favorite green tea mochi, but I love mochi anyways.

Afterwards, we walked towards the water because they told us there was a Waterside festival happening, and it's true there was a carnival "Frontier Days" type of thing going on, but that wasn't what we were interested in. Mina and I wanted to go back and sleep at that point, but Andrea had the idea to go to a park called Director's Park. We got there and it ended up just being a sitting area in the middle of downtown, less than spectacular. We called an uber to take us back to the hotel and went to sleep.

The next day, we woke up and walked downtown to go to brunch at a seafood place that was rated in the top 10 in the country. We ended up walking through a *much* better part of the city, the northwest side, which made me really like Portland a lot more. The day before, we walked from the Chinese district to the central part of downtown, and basically saw hundreds and hundreds of homeless people and junkies littering the streets. It was scary and gross, like the city couldn't take care of itself or provide for its own people. This area that we walked through, however, was a lot nicer and more commerical, with shops like Nike and Madewell. We sat outside for brunch, and I got a smoked salmon hash because I figured in the Pacific Northwest it's got to be great, and it was!

Afterwards, we went to a Stumptown nearby. I got a coconut cold brew, and we took that to Powell's book shop, the largest book store in America. It takes up a full block and is three stories tall. It's insane. We only made it through two rooms in an hour, because we commented and talked about all the books we saw. It was actually a lot more fun to be there than I would've thought it would have been. We ended up having to leave in order to make a tour at the International Rose Test Garden, which was about a 40 minute walk to the west of the city. We made it there just in time. The garden is free to the public, and it was a gorgeous, sunny, 70 degree day. The roses were in full bloom, and the whole garden smelled delicious. I had never smelled roses that sweet. Some stand out roses were the climbing ones, the ones named after famous people like Barbara Streisand and Julia Child, who actually picked hers because it had the color of butter. After an hour on that tour, we walked across the way to the Japanese Garden, which we had to pay to get in to. We were late for the tour, but caught the group and joined for a bit. They had a ton of gorgeous Japanese maples there. We ditched the tour after half an hour because we were tired and the lady talked too much. We got to see all their koi being fed, and at that time there was an American bonsai exhibition going on, which was awesome because I love bonsais. This guy was an American who trained under a Japanese bonsai master for 6 years, came back, and made bonsais out of American trees (including a redwood). The exhibition was in a great location with an amazing view of Mount Hood in the distance. We zipped through the rest of it, and walked back downtown.

Andrea has a thing for chocolate shops in cities, so we went to a place so she could get more chocolate, and we were actually right next to the other famous donut shop in Portland that everyone says is way better than Voodoo (and it was less crowded). At this place, I got a blueberry bourbon basil, and it was fantastic. The dough was really, really good. However, you can tell the aesthetic is different, because I felt like I had to appreciate every bite whereas at Voodoo it was just all guilty pleasure. Still good, though.

Afterwards we planned on shopping in order to take advantage of the "no sales tax" in Portland. We went to Target, and I got a tank top and desperately needed work out shorts. Then we went to the mall downtown, and I got a button down at HM. Then we found a cluster of food carts, which Portland is also famous for. They're not trucks, they're like mini houses that line the street and you order from. We found a Chinese one and I got chicken fried rice. We walked it to the benches that line an alley outside Voodoo donuts (we passed Voodoo a LOT). Then we walked to the bus station and made it back home by 11:30 PM.

Overall, Portland was cool. We didn't have a lot of time to see it, and I have a feeling there were other areas of the city that were better than downtown where all of the homeless junkies are. That kind of freaked me out, and I don't think I would ever want to live there. However, the time we spent in the areas we went to was just enough. Any more time and we would have been bored.
