Today I had my last "orientation" explaining how to register for the Duke and UC3M courses followed by a lecture on the history and culture of Andalucia. Today for the first (kind of second) time I felt extremely overwhelmed with the Spanish language and also the mannerisms of the culture here. I called my mom to vent, so thank you mom for listening to my problems!

To start, I'm going to Andalucia tomorrow, and we have the weekend (Friday to Sunday) free for ourselves. This means I have to find my own place to live and make my own plans. Well, Connor has a friend in Malaga who he wants to visit, and while I could go there, it's a little far (since our train back leaves from Sevilla), and I kind of want to meet more Spaniards instead of hanging with a ton of college kids like I already do in Madrid. So, where to stay this weekend has been hanging over my head already. Also, having class on Thursdays until 1:30 PM is apparently a problem! (Who knew!!!) There are flights that leave on Thursdays at 3:00 PM that are cheaper than the later ones, but I cannot make a flight like that! I can't make a flight in less than 1.30 hours!! So I've been worried about having to travel by myself, which the plane ride wouldn't be bad, it's more having to meet up with people while they are already exploring a city is a PAIN, also I wouldn't even have data in some of these places!

Today what happened specifically is that a class I got approved to take was written wrong. I tried to explain it to Eva, but she thought I was saying that my class wasn't approved so she just talked right over me in her 100000 mph Spanish, not stopping to hear what I have to say. Even if I did try to say something, it took so long that she would just talk over me anyways. It was extremely frustrating!

Then, Michael had bought his ticket for Barcelona in between our orientation and the lecture, but I didn't have time before the lecture started. This woman talked **forever**, way longer than she was supposed to, and the whole time I was worried that the flight Michael just bought would be sold out, it was at a bad time for me, etc. I just needed to get out of there! The Spanish way of talking is to elongate *any* sentiment that you are trying to get across. For example, instead of just saying:

"Tell your family if you don't like a certain food, and then they won't make it for you."

They say:

"You don't have to eat anything you don't want to here. Sometimes people here eat a food they don't like and they don't tell their family and then they're stuck eating that food when they could have just told them in the beginning they didn't like it. You should have an open dialogue with your family, telling them what you do and don't like. You can always ask me to tell them not to cook that food, but that's kind of roundabout... but also that's my job so don't worry if you ask me to do that, it's totally fine..." etc. etc.

I know I'm complaining, but I'm also capturing the feelings of frustration that come with living in another culture. I knew before coming here that Europeans don't have a great sense of punctuality, they take their time and do whatever they want. However, I didn't get the full impact until today when I found myself wishing I wouldn't be interrupted and wishing that the lecturer ended on time.

This feels like a very temporary frustration, because today I happened to have a lot of planning to do and a lot of stress on my mind, but I did feel these things. Here's to a better tomorrow!!
