I went to bed super early yesterday, around 10:30 PM. I was totally wiped out! It really paid off today, though, because I felt revved and ready to go! I woke up early because we had to go to some international school to register for classes. Really, we could have just stayed in the hotel, but they wanted to make sure we had reliable wifi to do it. It took me about 30 seconds to register for my classes, but we were there for over an hour. So, I bought my bus trip to Ronda because my Airbnb host accepted my request! I also looked up flights for Amsterdam, but they got like 50 euros more expensive than they were yesterday, so I didn't buy them. Why were we there for so long? It's because the boys couldn't figure out what classes they wanted to take so they were figuring it out there. Nuria and I kept joking that this was a clear case that women are much, much smarter than men! :)

Afterwards, we had free time to wander Sevilla. Nuria told us she likes to walk around Triana and look at some of the churches there because they're smaller and more intimate. The weather was really nice, overcast, and in the 50's probably, so perfect walking weather. We first went to Triana, which was across the river in Sevilla. I love that there's a river in Sevilla because it reminds me of Chicago geographically, and it looks like Amsterdam architecturally! We walked around the neighborhood, didn't really know where to find a church, but then stumbled upon a small one. The neighborhood was really cute, definitely a family oriented place.

Next we walked to El Parque de Maria Luisa, the biggest public park in Sevilla. It's huge, and so pretty. Right in the center of it is Plaza de España, which has a huge, huge half-circle building. In front of it are a ton of little horse shoe shaped benches with decorations from major cities in Spain. We saw Madrid, Sevilla, Granada...it was really cool to see. There were some soccer fans roaming around, shouting, and we figured out that a team called "Mirandsa" or something like that is in the quarter finals with Sevilla for the Copa del Rey. They're only a second league team, so it's huge for them! We walked through the closed down Christmas market that was there, although some places were open. It was still nice to see the remnants of the market! I stopped at a place that sold succulents and other herbs to smell the herbs. I asked the seller how to say succulent in Spanish, and then we started talking for a bit. He went to Florida two years ago and was telling us about it. I liked talking to him because Fernando (who's from Sevilla) told us that Sevillanos like to talk a lot, and they also think that Sevilla is the best city in the world. This guy fit both of the bills. He started having a conversation off of one question I had; I love it! He also asked us how we liked Sevilla and when we said we liked it, he's like, "Oh yeah it's the most beautiful city in the world, isn't it?!"

Next, we went to La Plaza de Toros to wait for Nuria, Eva, and Marcos to come so we could have lunch. We went to a Bodega next to the Plaza to get tapas. I ordered "jerez" (sherry) because I really wanted to try it and Sevilla is so close to Jerez that I knew it would be good. However, I *really* did not like it! It tasted like cough syrup!! Bleh! For tapas, I ordered tortilla española and mushrooms (cooked differently daily). Today it was fried mushrooms with mayonnaise and served with chips. The tortilla española was also served with mayonnaise... not sure why they love mayonnaise so much at that place! My lunch was really delicious. They also ordered a plate of jamón iberico to share, which I loveeeee. Nuria told me that a leg of that ham (that restaurants buy, not people) can go for 500 euros. It's insane. The process of making the ham is really intense!

After that, we met with Fernando to do a tour of La Alcázar, the palace of Sevilla. It really looked like La Alhambra, because it was originally build by Muslims. What was different and cool about this place, was a few things. First of all, there was an earthquake at some point in time after the Christians took it over, and a lot of it collapsed (although not all). It also collapsed in such a way that it folded over, so a lot of the pieces were salvageable. The king who lived there decided to remake La Alcázar exactly as it was using any pieces they could find from the remains. So, a lot of the higher parts of the palace have Christian things, whether it's Spanish or Latin words, paintings of past kings, or pictures of lions and castles. It's a cool mix of cultures.

After that, we walked through the oldest neighborhood in Sevilla called El Barrio de Santa Cruz. Here we saw the house Washington Irving stayed in while he lived there (this guy loves Spain), a cross with snakes on it, and passages that would only allow one person at a time to walk through because they were so thin! A lot of the walkways there are tiny, so it was fun to see that part of the city.

Afterwards, we had free time, and Gaal and Connor were hungry, so we went to get tapas. I wasn't so hungry, but hungry enough to get something small (thank God for tapas!). I got red wine and gazpacho, which is a typical dish in Andalucía. It's a cold tomato soup of sorts, which is perfect for the south when they have super hot days in the summer. It was a little cold and rainy when I got it, but I figured I have to! It was served to me in a glass like my wine glass, which surprised me that I drink it like a drink! It was really, really good in my opinion! Nuria doesn't like it, but I like it because it tastes like a more flavorful V8. It tasted like tomato and cucumber juices with a lot of garlic in it.

When we were walking through el Barrio de Santa Cruz, we passed by a flamenco studio that had a show that night and a discount for students. Gaal said he wanted to go there, so we decided to go to. When in Sevilla, do as the Sevillanos do! Funny enough, the male dancer that night had gone to Duke and taught flamenco to our dancing club called Sabrosura, which Gaal is in, so he learned some Flamenco from this guy! The dancing was absolutely beautiful. First, the male and female danced Sevillanos, then the woman danced Alegrías, and then the male danced (I forget the name). Everything was amazing. Flamenco focuses a lot on the feet (they wear tap shoes) and make a lot of noise. Their feet moved so fast, it was incredible. The guitarist was insane as well as the singer. I loved all of it! There's so much emotion in that dance that it just makes you want to learn flamenco and do it with them.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Flamenco! Ole!</p></center>

Connor had some friends in Sevilla, but they didn't want to go out tonight, so we decided to roam the city like we did in Granada. I told them about a place Tim Purtell told me to go because he studied in Sevilla, called Las Setas, and that we could go to the top and get a view of Sevilla. So we went there first, and bought tickets to go to the top (only 3 euros)! It's surprisingly short, you go from floor -1 to floor 2, but you somehow still see all of the views of Sevilla. Las Setas is like a huge, modern sculpture, totally out of place in historic Sevilla. The contrast was super cool! We got 360 views of Sevilla, and all the major buildings were lit up so we could see all the major places.

With our ticket came a free drink at a bar right next to Las Setas that was very similar to 100 Montaditos, a cheap, quick restaurant that serves beer and sandwiches. We sat there for a sec, then decided to go towards the river in search of something to eat for dinner. We came across what I seem at the best place we ever could have gone too. It's called La Chunga, after the name of a flamenco movie, and it was this little stand alone place that was super modern yet homie on the inside. It had hanging utensils from the ceiling, cool uncovered light fixtures, and wine from the top of the Windows to the ceiling. While we were walking the streets were pretty empty, but this place was totally packed inside and out, so we knew we had to go!

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">I love La Chunga</p></center>

We ordered three tapas to share, truffle mushroom croquetas, a margarita pizza, and asparagus risotto. All of it was INCREDIBLE. It's that cool foodie vibe that I love about America in Spain!!! And the fact that everyone around us was Spanish definitely helped a lot, too! At the end of our meal, we saw these guys next to us drinking out of these test tube type glass things some yellow liquid, so we asked them what it was. They said it was orrujo, a special type of Spanish liquor that one of them said was like jäger leister but another was like no way it doesn't taste like that. Whatever the case, we knew we had to try this Spanish drink that came in such a cool glass, so we did! Tres chupitos de orrujo por favor! It was a sweet drink that kind of burned, but it was good enough!

After that, we were close enough to the river and it was early enough that we decided to go to the bridge and sit on the ledge. We sat there for some time watching the lit up bridge and lazy river, looking at all the houses across from us that reminded me of Amsterdam. We talked a bit, sometimes shared the silence, and then we decided to call it a night.
