AMSTERDAM!!! Every young person's dream! I was super super pumped to go to Amsterdam, and it did not let down. I bought my flights separately from everyone else, so I had a layover in Frankfurt on the way there and back. It was cool to see the German airport, I guess! I am planning on going to Munich this spring break, but I can still kind of check Germany off my list (just kidding, not gonna do that yet).

I landed on Thursday night, took the train into central Amsterdam, and met up with Michael and Colton, who had been there for a few hours and were heading back to the hostel anyways. Our hostel is on the other side of the river so we have to take a ferry to cross, which runs 24/7, every 5 minutes, and is totally cool! When the boat comes everyone has to stand on the side because when they let the door down, a *flood* of people come pouring out, including a million bikes and mopeds! It's insane, the amount of people on bikes and vespas. I mean, you might know Amsterdam is known for bicycles beforehand, but you don't understand until you get there. There are parking garages dedicated to just bikes!

I got to my hostel room, which was similar to the last hostel we stayed in. Then we went back across the river into Amsterdam. We first stopped to get fries because we were all hungry, and missing the Belgian fries. We tried a new sauce called samurai, which is basically just spicy mayo, and it was **amazing**, probably the best sauce I've had the whole time! Next we went to a cafe to warm up a bit, then walked down the Red Light District.

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/amsterdam/15.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">This is the story of my life</p></center>

The Red Light District is a street lined with glass doors where women prostitutes stand provocatively and seek out their next client. It's illegal to take pictures there. I knew what it was in theory, but it's shocking to see in real life. I know it's legal there, but I still hope none of them are forced into that job somehow. It's also really disturbing to see men actually go inside, sorry if it's graphic, but it's so gross. After that we were all really tired so we just went to the hostel and to bed!

We planned on waking up early to get breakfast before the other girls came, but we all overslept so we just waited for everyone else to come before we left with them. We ended up getting burgers for breakfast because it was really noon and we all wanted burgers so badly! There are burger shops everywhere. I hadn't had a burger in so long, it was absolute heaven. I could've had 1000 of them. Then we went to a cafe, and made it our goal to see the I Amsterdam sign. We meandered our way through the city, stopping every once in a while to see something. We stopped in a cheese shop where they had samples of about 10 cheese, so of course we all tried them all and they were *delicious*. Not a single one was bad!!! Our favorite was the truffle cheese, for obviously reasons!

We also stopped at a pop up flea market, which at the time was mostly just selling books, posters, postcards, etc. We found a really cool postcard stand hat sold vintage post cards that actually have writing on the back from people who sent them! We each bought one or two, and then stopped at a modern cafe for our morning caffeine. They had the perfect thing I wanted: a caramel cappuccino. I have to say this to remember how amazing that coffee was. I wanted something strong, so not a latte, but something sweet, which usually only comes in lattes. The caramel cappuccino was totally perfect because cappuccinos are strong and the caramel was so good and sweet! I loved it so much I really did have to write all of that.

After that, we continued on, and finally came across the I Amsterdam sign! We took a lot of pictures on it, which was super fun because we got to climb on top of the letters and everyone who studies abroad has one of those pictures so we felt accomplished. That sign is also at the park that has the Van Gogh, Rembrandt and other museums, all lining a huge park. We didn't go to any museums, but we sat in the park for a while watching the sun go down.

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Me on another bike. We never actually rode bikes, I just stoof on ones that were locked to the bridges haha</p></center>

We went back to the hostel, as we always do, for a quick power nap before going out for the night. Those naps are almost the best part of these trips (just kidding). But that hit the spot, and we headed out again. We had tickets to go to the Ice Bar Amsterdam, so we went there first. It was so cool (hehe)! The bar was pirate themed, which was a little random, but before going in we got to have a drink called the Amsterdamed which was soooo good we all sucked it down instantly. It was vodka with cranberry juicy, peach juice, and lime. Then it was our time to go in, so we put on our gloves and huge overcoats that they give you and went inside. It was SO cold, so much colder than we were all expecting. It was about -9 degrees Celsius. Inside, we got two drinks, so we got whipped cream vodka with orange juice which tasted like a melted dreamsicle and this other one called nuts and nougat that tasted like Nutella. I don't know what that place does, but their drinks were absolutely delicious. Actually the whole weekend we were saying we should get the whipped cream vodka and orange juice ourselves because it was so good!

Then we stopped in some shops on the way back, mostly small and hipster, classic Amsterdam! We grabbed another burger at a place called Burger Bar which was great because they were higher quality than the other place. They would take the raw meat and measure it in grams before making your burger. It was truly beautiful. After that, we called it a night.  

The next morning, we decided to get up at 10 to take a 11:30 tour. We all took a little longer, and then went to get breakfast. The place we really wanted to go to that is called Pancakes was full, so we were almost gonna go somewhere else but then decided it's worth it to wait for pancakes and so we waited and decided to take the 2:30 tour. Thank God we waited!!! I asked the waiter what to get, and he recommended the Dutch pancake with apples, cinnamon, and ice cream. Well, my huge plate came out with a crepe looking pancake, a bowl of vanilla ice cream, and literally a slice of Dutch apple pie crumbled on top. It. Was. Heavenly. It was nothing like Walker Bros huge, sickly sweet Dutch Apple pancake. It was light, sweet, spiced, and tart. Total heaven.

When we left, we decided we didn't want to do the tour that day either because we were being lazy, so we walked around a bit until we found a cafe with enough space for all of us (cafes are super super small for 8 people and it was FREEZING cold in Amsterdam the whole weekend so we basically lived in cafes). We then went to the Amsterdam Cheese Museum, which Michaels friend told us about, where they had over 30 samples of cheese for free!!!!!!!! Yes, you heard that right. They were all soooo good, especially the Goudas which I think Holland is known for. Right next to that was the Tulip Museum, which we stopped in because one of the girls really wanted to see tulips but we had skipped the floating market the other day because we were cold and were also too cold to go to the outskirts of Amsterdam go see any gardens. However, there was just a gift shop and a museum that required money to get in, so gardens. So we just left. We found another cafe, and we stayed there for a few hours and decided to go back early to nap and then get an earlier dinner.

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}spain/amsterdam/11.jpg);"></div>
<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">Cheese Museum!!! Yes please!</p></center>

We overslept then, too, because we all needed to nap a lot. The girls slept in the airport two nights before because the Metro didn't open early enough for their flight, so they especially were super pooped. We took our nice, long nap, and then got going. I found a restaurant close by called Skek that was run by students, serves Dutch food and beer, and gives 25% off to students. Unfortunately when we got there, it was all full. So instead we went to another chain we had seen all weekend and wanted desperately, Wok to Walk. It's Asian stir fry and exactly what we needed. Obviously we didn't really eat Dutch food, but Dutch food is like not remarkable, so I'm okay with that. We hadn't tasted Asian flavors in so long, when we were all eating our stir fry we were in complete silence because we were so into our food. Do you see a pattern here? Lots of eating. But, I also talk a lot about eating because we don't like to spend money so a lot of times we just wander around the streets instead of going to an interesting museum or whatever. So, there's not a lot to tell about the in between time.

Here's this: Amsterdam is cool because it's built on top of the water. People are on bikes everywhere, the houses are cool, and no matter where you are there's a great view. Walking around, we never came across a part that seemed less popular than the others or more run down. All the parts of the main concentric circles of the city are super dense and all areas seem really cool in their own way! I can tell there are districts, but not neighborhoods in the way Chicago has neighborhoods that I saw. It's hard to travel in a huge group because every restaurant and cafe are in those tiny, narrow buildings, so they never have a ton of seating. I like Amsterdam more than Brussels because I feel like it has more on the streets. Parts of Brussels were more run down, residential, and night time hot spots were farther apart. In Amsterdam, every part is lively, hot spots are all close together, and no matter where you are you can find what you're looking for. Even though we were all dying of cold, we really loved it!!

After that, we tried going to a bar that we thought had a happy hour deal, but didn't, so we left and found another place to go that could hold us all. We all stayed there for only an hour or two because we were so exhausted again, and we knew we had to wake up early the next day for Anne Frank house. We didn't buy tickets online because they were sold out (sell out in about a month), so the best bet for us was to get in line at 8:30 AM (the house opens at 9). We went back to the hostel to sleep.

The next morning, we hope up bright and early to get to the house. We got there at 8:30, and only waited until about 9:30 to get in, which in my opinion was pretty good!! At this point there was a steady rain outside, but that didn't deter people. People were lined up so far that I read from where they were it would take 3 hours to get to the house. We were lucky!

<center><p style="font-size: 14px;">The house where Anne Frank hid</p></center>

The house was really cool to see. It really puts you in the shoes of Anne Frank and where she had to live. What affected me the most was the blacked out windows, and realizing she really had to live in the dark for almost two years. It's such a tragic story, but so touching that we are able to see her living quarters. We went through that museum in about an hour, and then went to a nearby Sara's Pancake House for breakfast.

I ordered a Dutch pancake with bacon, apples, cinnamon, and raisins (it was their top ordered pancake). It was soo delicious! I also got coffee which was well needed because we were so cold. We went back to the cheese museum so the girls could buy some cheese, then went to a cafe for a few hours getting out of the cold. We went looking for a bar with any type of cheap beer, but like I've said, everywhere is tiny so no place had enough space. We ended up going back to Burger Bar (after stopping in and out of places like tourist shops, nice looking wine places, other typical Amsterdam tourist stops, etc). They actually had Heineken there, which made me so happy!! I really wanted to try it. I got a small Heineken, and we chilled there, then it was my time to go. We said goodbye, and I went back to the hostel to get my stuff, get on the train, and to the airport! Now here I am waiting to board my plane, fingers tired from typing so much and dreading that I have to wake up at 7:30 AM tomorrow for class. This was a fantastic trip, and I'm glad I have such a nice, low maintenance group of friends I travelled with! This upcoming weekend, I'm staying in Madrid because we have a field trip to Toledo on Friday. After that, we are taking a long trip (Wed-Sun) to Budapest and Prague. I am absolutely in love with Europe!
