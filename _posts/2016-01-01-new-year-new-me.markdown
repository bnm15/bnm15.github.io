HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
-Me at midnight.

As I rang in the New Year, I couldn't help but think about how my 2015 was and how my 2016 will go. Shocker, right? Who thinks about what they've done and will do on New Years...?

Anyways, I thought about how just a year ago I was a puny freshman, deep into the freshman 15, elated about surviving my first *college* finals, nervous to be judged during rush, and happy to be reunited with my family after being gone for so long for the first time. It makes me laugh thinking about how much emotion I had over these now seemingly small things. Of course I did, I was a freshman in college, and all freshmen feel heightened emotions about things that seem small later on. That's the point of having freshmen around! To remind us of those times we had fun, little worries and triumphs. I was happy last year, and I'm happy this year.

This year what's my status? I'm "blogging", if you can call it that. Hoping to pick it up when actually abroad. I've found my niche of friends at school and study habits that work. I am, again, very glad to be with my family over this break. I've planned weekend trips for abroad, started buying last minute things I will need. I'm in a good place!

I've noticed bloggers tend to write about their resolutions for the upcoming year in their blog posts. The thing is, I'm not great at writing resolutions, and I almost don't like to because what I would like to do never really happens so now resolutions seem like empty promises. I can tell you some of my goals, though, because those don't have to be as *resolute*.

- Don't plan everything. This mostly goes for my abroad trips, because I tend to do that.
- Remember that you will get a chance to go to the places you miss. Rick Steves called it the "General MacArthur" approach to traveling.
- Stay at least a little fit. Don't fool yourself into thinking you'll work out every day, but try sometimes.
- Make eye contact with strangers. I don't know why, but I can never look strangers/passersby in the face. It's a weird phobia of mine. So work on that.

I don't know about you, but that seems like a good list to me. 2016 is going to be crazy enough as it is without me setting a billion goals for myself. 4 months on a different continent, traveling to endless new countries, 3 months in the upper left coast of the US, trying my hand at a career, 4 months on an entirely new continent, exploring my culture and heritage. Remember when I thought leaving home for college (returning 3 months later for Thanksgiving) was a big, scary ordeal? Oh, yeah...

I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS YEAR.
