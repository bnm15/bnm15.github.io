Today is the last day. In fact, it's the last day of a lot of things. The last day of finals. The last day I'm allowed in Apartment F. The last day I will sit in my favorite spot at ABP eating my favorite bagel. The last day I will be on Duke's campus for a year.

But, it's the first of a lot of things, too. It's the first day of winter break. It's the first day I don't have insane CS work to do. It's the first day I can dedicate my thoughts on what's coming ahead. It's the first, last day before my life's greatest adventure.

I wanted to write this post to capture how I feel at this moment. Over the past few days, I've felt extremely sad because I'm leaving a place that I love. I'm not leaving to get away from it all - Duke, the stress of school, social hierarchies. I'm leaving because it's really the only time we can travel at such an extent with no responsibility. Thinking that the amount of time I've spent already here - 3 semesters - is exactly the amount of time I'll have left when I get back makes me feel desperate for more time here. I get really sentimental about leaving places, even though it may be hard for me to say goodbye.

I got Monuts with my amazing roommate yesterday morning, which is pretty representative of my perfect Durham day. Eating a yummy white chocolate raspberry raised donut with my best friend and my other best friend roommate (her beau), is really my perfect picture of content.

Maybe this is why it was so hard for me to focus on anything the last two days here. The last thing on my mind was cramming for my Math exam. Sitting in the apartment with completely bare walls, an empty bed, empty closets, empty kitchen, was too much. I felt close to tears though they did not come (until I saw my Physics grade, yikes!).

Recently everyone's been asking me how excited I am to leave to go abroad. Usually I tried to muster up enough emotion to satisfy them, but at this point I am making room for sadness. I don't feel compelled to feel thrilled because there will be a time for that, like when I'm on the plane ride there. Right now, I need my time to breathe in my last breaths of sweet Carolina air and let the moroseness wash over me.
