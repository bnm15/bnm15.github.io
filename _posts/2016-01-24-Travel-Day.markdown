I'm extremely tired, so this is going to be quick! I woke up, got a crepe at Ronda Sweet Bakery, then saw the school Entre Lenguas that Mar and Alex own. It was really, really cool, and they teach Spanish through activities like wine tastings, cooking classes, and gardening. They're awesome people!

I left around noon to get on my bus back to Sevilla. I was sad to leave, but also felt like two nights in Ronda was enough for me to feel content. Getting back to Sevilla, I met up with Connor at 100 Montaditos for lunch, then we cabbed it to the train station. We took the Ave back to Madrid; I was on and off sleeping the whole time.

Pilar picked me up from Atoche and we ate dinner: lentil soup, salad, and salmon with honey onions. Then I met up with Michael and some of his friends to go to a karaoke bar, which was horrible, so we ended up just leaving after about an hour to go home. That's fine with me, because I have to wake up at 7:30 tomorrow for my first class! Wish me luck!
