*Technically I am writing this on May 5, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

This post probably won't be so exciting because these were just two day trips that we took with the Duke program, and were more tour-y than anything... But who cares!

First, we went to Toledo the 19th of February, which was the weekend before Budapest and Prague, however I am just shoving these two trips together in the same post. Toledo is kind of a big deal in Spain because it was the capital of Spain since the Muslim rule (1000 AD) until the rule of Felipe II, when he moved the capital to Madrid in 1561. Toledo is an island of sorts, a piece of land completely surrounded by a river, making it naturally easy to defend, and a good place to keep a capital, until the population kept increasing and increasing and there eventually was just no more space for people to go so Felipe II moved it.

Anyways, Toledo is known as the city of three religions, because it has Muslim, Jewish, and Christian influences. It's a very old city, even with Roman stone walls surrounding it. When we first arrived to Toledo, we stopped at a hotel up on a nearby mountain to get hot chocolate (which is literally melted chocolate, no milk, sooo rich and good!), and to see the view of the whole city. It was a great spot, and I felt really lucky because they said that normally they can't go up there with big groups, but because we are only 3 students, we could do it. :)

Our first stop was a Muslim mosque, then the Catholic cathedral. The mosque was small and very old, and the cathedral was huge and really beautiful. Then we went to a workshop that makes damascene jewelry, which is really famous in Toledo (as well as swords..). It was really interesting to watch them make the jewelry with tiny ribbons of gold, hammering it on to the metal. Then we ate lunch outside on a plaza in front of the cathedral. It was a pretty nice day outside, and before we met up again we bought marzapan from the most famous shop, because that is the other very famous thing from Toledo. Lastly, we went to the Jewish Temple, which was really cool because I don't think I'd been in a temple before. It was made in a very Arabic style, however, so it wasn't necessarily traditional Jewish decor. Right before leaving, Connor and I found a park and decided to hop a fence and slide down the mountain side to get nice pictures in front of the river and bridge of Toledo. When Nuria saw us she flipped, because it was kind of dangerous, but it was soo worth it and Connor and I decided it was the best part of the trip. And that was our day in Toledo!

Second, we went to Segovia the weekend after Budapest and Prague. Segovia is known as a really charming place with a castle reminiscent of Disney and the famous Roman aquaduct.
