*Technically I am writing this on May 5, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

This post probably won't be so exciting because these were just two day trips that we took with the Duke program, and were more tour-y than anything... But who cares!

First, we went to Toledo the 19th of February, which was the weekend before Budapest and Prague, however I am just shoving these two trips together in the same post. Toledo is kind of a big deal in Spain because it was the capital of Spain since the Muslim rule (1000 AD) until the rule of Felipe II, when he moved the capital to Madrid in 1561. Toledo is an island of sorts, a piece of land completely surrounded by a river, making it naturally easy to defend, and a good place to keep a capital, until the population kept increasing and increasing and there eventually was just no more space for people to go so Felipe II moved it.

Anyways, Toledo is known as the city of three religions, because it has Muslim, Jewish, and Christian influences. It's a very old city, even with Roman stone walls surrounding it. When we first arrived to Toledo, we stopped at a hotel up on a nearby mountain to get hot chocolate (which is literally melted chocolate, no milk, sooo rich and good!), and to see the view of the whole city. It was a great spot, and I felt really lucky because they said that normally they can't go up there with big groups, but because we are only 3 students, we could do it. :)

Our first stop was a Muslim mosque, then the Catholic cathedral. The mosque was small and very old, and the cathedral was huge and really beautiful. Then we went to a workshop that makes damascene jewelry, which is really famous in Toledo (as well as swords..). It was really interesting to watch them make the jewelry with tiny ribbons of gold, hammering it on to the metal. Then we ate lunch outside on a plaza in front of the cathedral. It was a pretty nice day outside, and before we met up again we bought marzapan from the most famous shop, because that is the other very famous thing from Toledo. Lastly, we went to the Jewish Temple, which was really cool because I don't think I'd been in a temple before. It was made in a very Arabic style, however, so it wasn't necessarily traditional Jewish decor. Right before leaving, Connor and I found a park and decided to hop a fence and slide down the mountain side to get nice pictures in front of the river and bridge of Toledo. When Nuria saw us she flipped, because it was kind of dangerous, but it was soo worth it and Connor and I decided it was the best part of the trip. And that was our day in Toledo!

Second, we went to Segovia the weekend after Budapest and Prague. Segovia is known as a really charming place with a castle reminiscent of Disney and the famous Roman aqueduct. Our tour guide on this trip was not my favorite because she just kept talking and talking and talking about things that were not interesting, but we moved past it.

We learned a lot about the aqueduct, which was built by the Romans, and amazingly uses NO concrete. The rocks literally hold each other up, because they are cut so perfectly that they can bear their own weight. Keep in mind these stones and the aqueduct in general is about 2000 years old... The Romans are just an amazing group of people.

We walked the length of the aqueduct, leading up to the city center and where the aqueduct is the tallest. We then walked to a small cathedral where there were original frescos, and we literally were in there for about an hour, in the cold, while this teacher blabbered on about the fresco which wasn't even huge/completely intact/fantastic. That was the point where she annoyed us the most. But then, it wasn't that bad. Then we had time for lunch, which we ate alongside the aqueduct and had a great view of the aqueduct and the Sierra Nevada mountains in the back. Truly a sight to see!

We also went to the castle of Segovia, the one that looks like a Disney castle. They had a small armory, which was cool, and we got to see the thrones of Isabelle and Fernando. Overall that castle was really pretty and medieval, but unfortunately the tower at the top that would have given us a full view of Segovia was closed. But, oh well! I can always go back!

Then we left Segovia to go to La Granja, a little village close by where the Bourbon Palace is, which is very reminiscent of Versailles. There was actually snow on the ground there, which was awesome! The first time I had actually seen snow on the ground all year! Before going in, Eva had bought us traditional Segovian pastries called Ponche Segoviano, which is a cake with cream filling wrapped/covered in marzapan. It really was the definition of a sugar bomb, but really good! Anyways, the Bourbons of Spain were obsessed with French culture and Versailles, so they brought all of the Baroque design to Spain. That palace was really beautiful, and seeing the Baroque design to it was new to me, really impressionable. Finally, we headed home, wiped from the day.

These two trips were cool because we got out of Madrid and got to see the surrounding area through a day trip. Some of my SLU friends had gone to those places, but we actually had a tour guide the whole time, which helped me a lot to learn about the area. Also going to La Granja was something I would never have known to do. These two places are definitely only day trip worthy, but I'm glad they were included in the program. I got a lot of cool pictures out of it, too!
