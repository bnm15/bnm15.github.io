*Technically I am writing this on May 5, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*


I had planned on going to Barcelona as one of our first weekends because I already had a trip to Barcelona planned on my program but Michael didn't and so it was more convenient for us both to go together so we could see our friends from the exchange. It worked out really well because and Michael got go to Barcelona and we could all see each other at the same time and I would just go back later with my program. We talk to Sarah about it beforehand and knew that we could stay with her for that weekend and also that weekend was the weekend of carnaval which is a super big party in Spain for the start of lent.


We arrived in Barcelona super excited to see Sarah who is waiting for us outside terminal and we ran up to her and hugs for such a long time and then we finally figured out how to get on the bus and the metro to go back to her house. We quickly dropped our stuff off at her house and then went to the Apple store in Plaza Catalunya so that Michael could buy a new iPhone because his had gotten mugged a few days before in Madrid. That actually took a while, but afterwards we went back to Sara's house and saw her parents again who are sooo nice and were so happy to see us again. We were going to go out that night, but everyone was so tired and Sara had class the next day at 8 AM which means we had to wake up at 6 AM, so we decided to go to sleep.

The next morning, we took the metro to the bus to Sara's university, which is literally on the beach. The sun was just coming up, so we stopped on the beach to take some pictures before Sara went to class, and we ended up taking so long that Sara decided not to go to class altogether. We took great pictures on the beach as the sun was coming up which was beautiful :).

We went and got coffee with her friends at her school's cafeteria, and I saw Nacho for the first time in two years!! We then walked over to their school's library, which was really pretty and apparently used to be an old water tank. Then we walked to Meri's campus, bought our costumes for carnaval, and saw Meri! We had a good time all together talking for about an hour, then Meri and Nacho had to leave, which actually was the only time I saw either of them.

Then we went back to Sara's house, napped because we had to wake up so early that day, and then got ready to go out. We ate dinner at an amazing sushi place and then went to a cool shot bar with over 100 shots, all super cool and different. While we were there, though, Michael started feeling sick (probably because he had like 4 globs of wasabi!), so we went back to Sara's and went to sleep.

The next day we woke up and packed some stuff and got ready for Cubelles, a town on the coast a little south of Barcelona where Sara has a vacation home. We took the train and got to her house, which was just adorable. We explored Cubelles a little bit (in our carnaval costumes! I was a giraffe, Michael a cow, and Sara a tiger). Then we ate paella with Sara's family, which was delicious. For dinner we had a ton of jamón, queso, and pan, and then we got ready to go to Sitges, the bigger beach town right near Cubelles and where a lot of people go for carnaval.

At Sitges we went to the beach and sat down and just talking and played some games. We met a group of people working in Barcelona, one was French, one German, and one Mexican. It was really cool to talk to all of them and realize that I was in a place just full of a million different cultures. It's rare to meet anyone international in the US like that, and yet in Europe it's so easy to met and learn from so many people from all over. That was such a highlight of the weekend, sitting there and talking to people who are just so different and yet we are all in the same place at the same time having a good time together.

It started to rain, so we wandered the streets of Sitges and decided to go back to Cubelles on the train. The train took about 3 hours to get there, so we were absolutely dead and just went immediately to sleep.

The next day, we went to the beach because it was a nicer day out to take pictures. We eventually made our way back to Barcelona, packed up, and went to the airport. This weekend was more relaxed, but it was cool to see a different beach town of Barcelona considering we had already been in Barcelona. It was fun to spend carnaval there, too. Also, of course we absolutely LOVED seeing Sara. Although we slept a ton the whole weekend, I couldn't believe that a friendship like that could last so long and still have so much meaning. It was really a great time.
