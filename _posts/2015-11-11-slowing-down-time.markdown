Today in between classes I really felt like procrastinating. Really, though, that’s not a shock, because the sophomore slump is the most real phenomena I’ve ever experienced in my life. Don’t know what I mean? Please read this <a href="http://theodysseyonline.com/saint-michaels/10-signs-sophomore-slump/204404" target="_blank">post</a> from the Odyssey about it, because that perfectly describes my life at the moment.

Anyway, I decided to pass the time by creating a nice Excel calendar of the five months I’ll be in Spain. I had been meaning to do this in order to see how many weekends I’ll have to travel, when certain tests are happening, and when the group field trips occur. I’m a visual planner, so this is what a portion of my calendar turned out looking like.

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}calendar_sample.jpg);"></div>

Isn’t it pretty?! I thought so too, until I realized that in the past, making calendars and extensively planning things out makes time go by way too fast. For me, constantly looking at a calendar just makes me yearn to be in another time. If I had this calendar with me in Madrid, starting every Monday, I would just wish it were Friday. On the weekends, I would be dreaming about the next weekend of fun I’ll be having. Then it starts all over again. At what point would I be thinking about the time I’m living in, and not the next weekend that I’ve planned, or our awesome spring break trip coming up?

Looking at the calendar every day would remind me that I only have this many weeks left and that I only have this many trips left. Sure, it’s good to be organized and have a basic understanding of what you want to do in order to ensure no regrets. That’s great. However, I need to nudge aside my extreme need of pretty calendars and planning every day, because I want to live in the present. It’s cliché, but cliché’s exist for a reason. My time abroad should be spent freely and according to what I decide in the moment. Structure is good, but allowing yourself to dynamically change outside of rigid bounds is better. I think living without a finite sense of time and a visible end point slows everything down, which is exactly what I intend to do to make my times abroad feel endless.

I had no idea a calendar would make me think this much, but I’m glad it did. It’s good that it showed me the layout of my time, but I won’t be opening that spreadsheet again.
