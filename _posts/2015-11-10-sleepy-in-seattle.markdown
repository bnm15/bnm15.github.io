In mid-October I went to Seattle, WA for the first time. I was so excited because one of my good friends from Seattle told me I would absolutely love the city, particularly Capitol Hill because of its indie alternative culture. Going to Seattle had never really crossed my mind, and I was only going to be there for 48 hours, so in the days leading up to my departure I furiously scavenged through Pinterest and asked my friends for recommendations on things to do. Part of the difficulty of planning my escapade was that I would be alone, which was new to me. It takes a certain level of self-confidence to explore a new city by yourself, but I was determined to get past that, especially since situations like this will arise often in my travels through Europe or Asia. So, I made my to-do list and hopped on the plane.

Looking out the window while we were landing took my breath away. Fall was snuggling in close with the evergreens that spanned as far as I could see. Honestly, my first thought was, “This is what Forks, WA, looks like in Twilight!” I had never seen a landscape covered in such vibrantly colored pines with weaving rivers and lakes. Needless to say, I was thrilled to spend time in the city during one of the most beautiful times of the year.

After I landed, I checked into my hotel, which was located in Bellevue on the eastern side of Lake Washington. By then I was starving so I went to check off my first eatery: Honeyhole. I found out about Honeyhole by searching on Spoon University UW (which I highly recommend if you want local recommendations while you’re traveling, as the articles are written by students in the area). Unfortunately, I panicked when I went to order because I didn’t know how to order (lol), so I ended up getting a roast beef sandwich with horseradish and au jus. I loved the au jus and the meat, but the horseradish was way too spicy for me! Nevertheless, I was happy with my meal.

I then perused the area and noticed the number one place I wanted to go to was right near by. That place is Stumptown Coffee. Boy, what a treat! I am a huge coffee drinker, and I heard on a podcast from another coffee lover that her favorite coffee she’s ever drunk (and she’s been all over the world) was Stumptown in Seattle. I went in expecting a huge line, but it was completely empty save one patron. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at the window to people watch. The cappuccino was unlike anything I had ever tasted; it was so creamy and not bitter, but still held the espresso flavor well. I was so happy :).

Seeing all of the people walking by was the biggest shock to me because it was a culture shock. I was not expecting to feel a culture shock in another US city! Everyone walking by was so authentically grunge. I’m used to the put-together, alternative style of Chicago, the lumberjack-esque fashion of Durham, but I had not been prepared to see the homeless style grunge that I saw in Seattle, and it was awesome. It was like being in an episode of Portlandia. Later, I found out that I was in Capitol Hill, the hipster neighborhood of Seattle, but at the time I thought this was the main part of the city, and I loved it. Walking back to my car, I was following closely to the guy in front of me just by chance, and he turned around at one point and gave me a look. I meekly said, “I’m not following you, I swear!”, which ended up leading to a conversation for the duration our our common path. I asked him for recommendations on things to do, one of which I went to the next day. There’s something so special about a place in which people are happy to talk to complete strangers. Less than 4 hours in, and Seattle had already stolen my heart.

The next day, I connected with a group of people my age to explore the city. We meandered through Pike Place market, stopping in the OGSB (original Starbucks). I talked to a great dude there who really knew his coffee, and suggested to me his favorite dark roast in a pour over (which was fantastic). I wouldn’t recommend waiting in line for the OGSB, but when I went, there was no line so it was very convenient. Then we headed to the big park with a ton of museums and the Space Needle. We went to the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum, which was incredibly beautiful. Some of the pieces in there had previously hung in Venice, Italy, and some were over 25 feet high. Chihuly is from Seattle, so they greatly respected telling his story in each room and digging into his background as an artist instead of simply exhibiting the art.

After that, we went to the top of the Space Needle just in time for sunset. We went on the outdoor deck and looked around. I saw some mountains in the distance and asked if anyone knew if that was Mt. Rainier, but no one knew. It seemed like a big mountain, so I figured it was. Then, of course, I walk around to the other side and am completely blown away, because there was the real Mt. Rainier! It’s huge! It was absolutely a site to see, especially coming from Chicago where mountains (or even hills, honestly) are nonexistent. The view and sunset were beautiful; it was a really magical ending to the day.

The last thing we did was go to Cuoco, a restaurant by Seattle chef Tom Douglas. This was the recommendation the gentleman from the day before gave me. It was a nice, Italian restaurant a ways north of downtown Seattle. My dish was spectacular, a spicy seafood spaghetti made with squid ink. Everyone else loved their dishes too, so I would highly recommend this restaurant next time you’re in Seattle.

I went back to my hotel and passed out around 10pm. Sad, right? I’m supposed to be sleepless in Seattle, and here I am passing out so early! I blame it on the 3 hour time change.

The next morning, I woke up extremely early, like 6am. I thought that was great because I would have to go to the airport around noon, and I would have six hours to get more things done. I then realized almost everything I wanted to do was closed because it was too early, so I chose my only option: going to the Starbuck’s Reserve room (the largest in the world). The barista from yesterday told me I could get a flight of coffees to try. I went there kind of confused on how ordering worked, and asked someone if I could get a flight. His response was, “Are you by yourself? You want one for yourself?” By this point, I had decided I’m going to be the most confident solo traveler ever, so I said, “Uh, yeah, I love coffee!” So I got my flight and compared a roast with Clover brewing and pour over, ultimately deciding the pour over was my favorite. After I left, I was really hungry, but the breakfast place I wanted to go to wasn’t opening for another hour, so I went to Volunteer Park in the north side of Capitol Hill, hoping I could get in to the conservatory because I had seen pictures online that were gorgeous. Of course, it wasn’t opening for a long time. So, I walked around the park and just took in the brisk air until it was time to get breakfast.

I went to Morsel, and HAD THE BEST BREAKFAST I’VE EVER EATEN. Yeah. Seriously. PLEASE go to Seattle, go to Morsel, and get the Spanish fly on a cheddar and chive biscuit. Your life will change. I actually wrote a review of it on Yelp, so I won’t disclose the full details, but I basically had the biggest food-gasm I’ve ever had in my life. I still dream about it.

Anyways, after that episode of mine, I went to Kerry Park because my friend from Seattle told me that was the place to go in Seattle. It took me a long time to figure out even where it was on Google Maps because it was so small, but I did end up finding it, and I second the recommendation to go there when in Seattle. The tiny little park somehow has the best view of Seattle in Seattle. You get a perfect view of the Space Needle and Mt. Rainier, and it is located in a very nice neighborhood that begs you to walk around and gawk at the beautiful houses.

I finished off my trip by returning to Volunteer Park for the conservatory. I have to say, it was extremely worth it. There are five sections, each containing different themes or geographies of plants. They have a huge collection of carnivorous plants, which is rare and cool to see in real life. They also had a whole section dedicated to succulents and cacti, which was beautiful. I love succulents because they are simple, easy to take care of, and naturally beautiful. They don’t put up a show, they just are. I talked to a cool guy I met there, who seemed like he was a nomad. He had just come from living in Kentucky and he was debating if he should move to Arizona or Greensboro next. We had a nice chat about traveling and the beauties of Seattle.

A last to-do I have for you is to drive from Bellevue to Seattle through Mercer Island. The views are incredible. It was kind of funny the first time I drove that way because I shouted out loud when I saw the view for the first time. Going through Mercer, you are in a tunnel, and then all of a sudden you leave the tunnel and are over the water with a full 180 of Seattle and the landscape in front of you. It’s hard to keep your eyes on the road, that’s for sure. Then you enter another tunnel with “Portal to the Pacific” written on it, and it all feels very magical.

Finally I drove back to the airport, saying goodbye to my wonderful two day affair with the city. I don’t know when I’ll be back, but I’m looking forward to it.
