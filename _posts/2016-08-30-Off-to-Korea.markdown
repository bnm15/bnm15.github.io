After spending a good week at home, I'm off again! Off to South Korea; it will be my first time in Asia. To be honest, I can't really say I'm nervous or excited or even know what to expect because I felt that I didn't have enough time to research and get hyped for this semester! It's not good or bad, just what happened. With my internship over the summer and busy with my boyfriend and friends, I barely had time to myself to research what I would want to research or figure out what I should expect when I'm there. It's going to be a new type of traveling to me, hopefully I enjoy it!

I flew with China Eastern, which wasn't so bad (really all airlines are kind of the same when you're sitting in economy). The issue was I figured out I was flying from the morning until 7 PM in China time, so basically I had to stay up for the entire flight. I would land at 6 AM Chicago time. That was going to be rough. Luckily, there were a lot of good movies on the plane, so I watched about 6 movies. I almost fell asleep at the end but pushed through like a champ.

I landed in the Shanghai Pudong airport and waited for the bus to transfer to Hongqiao on the other side of the city. I sat next to a guy who turned out to have lived in Seoul for two years. He told me about the nightlife, the food, and certain places to stay. He sounded pretty cool, he worked there for two years, traveled around SE Asia and South America for over a year, and then now is working in Shanghai. He's from Minnesota, so it gave me hope that I can have a cool life like that too!

I made it to Hongqiao, super super tired, and realized that I was in the wrong terminal. To get to T1 I had to take the metro, so I had to go through security (they have security everywhere there) with my bags, get on the crowded Chiense metro, and head to T1. I made it there, and realized there was no one and no where to sit, so I asked a guard where I could get a hotel. Luckily there was one not too far, and I really needed to sleep to not be jet lagged and also because I had been up for about 24 hours, so I checked in there and slept right away.

I went back to Hongqiao the next morning and waited for my flight to Seoul. It was there that I finally connected to wifi, and then I realized that China blocks Facebook and other messaging apps, so all I could do is iMessage mom and send an email/Fitbit message Justin. It was tough because I thought I would be able to check in with everyone much earlier, but there was no wifi anywhere! Even in the hotel they had a network cable but no wifi. What!!

The flight to Seoul was really short, a little over an hour. I took a cab to my hasookjib and entered the place I would call home for the next four months! Mrs. Lee, the woman who owns the house, came and showed me my room. I knew then that she did not speak any Korean, so I wouldn't be able to communicate with her. Luckily there was a girl there to help translate for me, she was Chinese and also studying at Yonsei. I spent about an hour unpacking my stuff. My room had a twin bed, one metal clothes rack with two shelves, and a desk with a couple drawers. It wasn't as much furniture as I thought it would be, but it turned out to be enough for all of my stuff.

I met the girl across from me, Nazzi, from Uzbekistan who is older and studying Korean language here because she works in tourism in her home town. She showed me around Yonsei for a bit and then she told me where I could go to buy shampoo, conditioner, etc. I went down the main Sinchon-ro right off of Yonsei's campus, and that street was awesome it looked amazing, full of stores and cafes and restaurants. It looked like a classic Asian road full of tons and tons of signs to look at and just so many colors and lights everywhere. Walking down that street I felt weirdly comfortable, considering it was my first day and I was walking down a street at a place I had never been to before. I think in Spain I was always extremely concerned with what other people thought of me, I'm not sure if it's because I knew the language and was afraid of interacting with my language skills, whereas in Korea I absolutely did not know the language so maybe I felt some comfort in knowing I couldn't embarrass myself by trying. I also thought about the fact that I'm more accustomed to having so many stores around and so many things available in the US. In Spain, they don't have stores for literally everything or big convenience stores like Target around, so it could be that I felt uncomfortable with the lack of accessibility, whereas in Korea everything is literally available all the time, there's so much food 24/7, toiletries everywhere, convenience stores are every other store, so I felt more comfortable knowing I could never get lost or stuck.

That's what I was thinking as I was walking down that street feeling very natural. I was also thinking that I'm used to seeing groups of Koreans speaking in Korean at home, (or Chinese, Japanese, etc), whereas I don't always see groups of Europeans speaking their own language. Therefore, I was more comfortable seeing these groups of young people around and in Spain I was more afraid because I wasn't used to seeing groups of Spanish speakers everywhere. It may sound weird, but it makes sense to me somehow.

I bought my toiletries and also a million face masks because I want my skin to be radiant, and headed home. I had dinner at home, and met a few girls from the house. They all were Asian (Taiwanese, Thai, Chinese, Korean), and all were studying at Yonsei. Only one was not a graduate student, and we decided to go to orientation the next day together. I also connected with Alex's friend from UChicago who was studying at Yonsei, so we talked on FB messenger and agreed to meet the next day.

I went to campus with Fe, the Taiwanese girl from my house, and we got green tea lattes before going into orientaiton. I found Jackie (Alex's friend) and her friend Elizabeth pretty quickly, and we went inside to orientation together. They just talked about classes, and then we had a break for lunch. We all went into Sinchon (the poppin area right outside the main gate where that main street I walked on is). We found a place to eat and we got spicy tofu soup. They had baskets of eggs on the table that you could crack into the soup yourself, it was SO good. I loved that, and the egg so much.

We went to the second half of orientation, which was more about student groups. I'm going to join one student group called Mentors club that pairs 5 exchange students with Korean students, and maybe another one called IYC that sounds like a lot of fun where they just have big get togethers throughout the semester, there's no other purpose to the club. I met a lot of international students at orientation, and then right after, Mentors club was leading us all to dinner. We went into Sinchon and went to a chicken and beer restaurant (Koreans love their chicken and beer), and I sat with a group of a German, Dutch, Jamaican, Taiwanese, and French. It was pretty cool :). The chicken was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I have to say. It was the best fried chicken I have ever had in my whole life. I don't know how they make the chicken so moist and delicious, but holy cow that was just incredible. There were three kinds, a dry spicy one, a wet spicy one, and a plain one. The spicy ones were SO incredibly spicy we were dying (and thus chugging some beer). But man even just the plain fried chicken was the best thing I have ever tasted, I want to go back to that place more.

After that, mentors club hosted us at a bar called Bar Fly right next door, so we all went. They gave us a few free drinks, and we danced for a few hours. The party started at 7, which is just insanely early, I can't even fathom that we went to a dance bar at 7, so I left around 10:30 because I was tired and that was just enough for me. I was added to a chat with other internationals on Kakao talk (the messaging app they use here), who were planning to go to Gyeongbokgung Palace the next day. I heard there was a girl who had been to Seoul before, so she was going to show us around. I met them at the Sinchon metro station, and we headed to the palace.

The palace was totally huge. I thought at first it was just the first building that we saw, but it ended up being a whole park full of different Asian houses that had beautiful architecture and were so cool to see. There was a lot of Chinese writing on them, and luckily one of us waas Taiwanese so he would tell us what the Chinese words say. I thought it was so amazing to see and was a good introduction to Korea, it kind of kicked me into gear that I was actually in Seoul. Unfortunately I didn't know any of the history of the area, but I still really enjoyed exploring the palace and am hoping to learn more in my Korean history class. At the end of all the areas there is the Korean Folk Museum which we walked around for a bit but it was not that exciting and we were all soo hungry, so we left to go out and eat.

We walked down a street with some street food that looked really interesting and some vendors with Korean gifts. We found a side alley to go down with food, which ended up being a dumpling place. I got hot dumpling soup, which was really good and not that spicy. We were thankful for that meal!

Afterwards we went down this street that had little house looking stores, mosty clothes and accessories. It was right near two schools that looked like high schools. We passed that on our way to the Hanok village, which is a little area full of traditional Korean houses that people still actually live in. We didn't spend a lot of time there, so I didn't take any pictures and we didn't really see a ton, but I have a feeling I'll go back there. We went home after that.

That's it for the first experience in Seoul! After that we went on a trip to Busan, which will be another post. I'm really loving it so far!!!
