*Technically I am writing this on July 10, 2016, because I got lazy in writing my posts, however, better late than never!*

At first, Michael and I were planning on getting to Cinque Terre by ourselves, but he had heard from a lot of people to go through a day tour company. The night before we wanted to go, we bought our day trip. There were two options, one involved hiking and one didn't, and the one that didn't was sold out by the time we got around to buying them. The hiking made us nervous because they wrote on the website that you need to be pretty fit to do it, but we signed up anyway! Two of our friends, Claire and Sydney, were also going to Cinque Terre, but on the other trip, so we were hoping to overlap with them for a little bit.

We woke up early and went to the bus station and found our group. The bus ride was about 2 hours, Michael slept the whole time and I only did in the beginning, so I was able to pay attention to what the tour guides were saying about the areas we were passing. We passed the place where *all* carrara marble comes from. How cool is that??? We could see the mountains where they get it, and the huge slabs sitting there waiting to be shipped out. All of the carrara!! We also passed a small town that apparently all they do there is make luxury toilet paper, which is funny.

We passed the main city of La Spezia, which is where you would go to from Florence and then transfer to one of the towns in Cinque Terre if you took the train. It's the closest main city to Cinque Terre. It's a very industrial town, and because it's right on the water they have a huge shipping industry.

We made it to Cinque Terre, and got off in our first town, Manarola, which is the second south-most town of the five. These towns are so small, and Manarola had ONE street called Main Street running through it, and that's it. We quickly walked up and down that street, saw an old clock tower, and then our guide took us up a side mountain so we could get a great view of Manarola. He said that we came **just** before busy season, so we were able to do a lot more without having thousands of people walking through Cinque Terre and it was nicer to wander the streets without a million tourists. It was perfect timing for us!

The whole group met at the train station, and the tickets we had were covered by the company so that was nice and way less complicated. We hopped on the train to the next town, Corniglia, to the north. This was the town where we were going to eat lunch. The train dropped us off down by the shore, and the town was higher up, so we had to climb quite a bit of stairs to get to the top. Our group was split into two, and it worked out that my group was full of the young college/recently graduated kids and the other group was the adults. My group basically ran up the steps, which was tiring but worth it, and the other group mostly took a bus to the top. We made it to the top of the stairs, and then they took us to a terrace that had *just* finished being built and we were the first group they could bring to it. How lucky is that?! We enjoyed the view from there, and then went to eat lunch. We had a great view from that restaurant, and ate outside. Our lunch was some seafood salad, which was so fresh, and pesto pasta, which is a huge deal in that area. With their pesto they add green beans and potatoes, which was different but so good!

It was after lunch that we did our hike (not sure why they do it that way haha). The hike goes from Corniglia to the next town to the north, Vernazza, which is possibly the most popular town, and I think the one most people go to first if they plan the trip themselves. I'm pretty sure you can hike between all of the towns, but we only did this one hike. We were all dreading this and super nervous, because they made it seem like an extremely hard hike. Really, it was really flat, so it wasn't cardio-hard, but the difficulty was in the slippy and uneven rocks. Those trails existed for thousands (maybe hundreds) of years, and weren't very well maintained. But because we were young and nimble, it wasn't bad at all!! It was actually a really nice hike because we got amazing views of the towns and got to hike through the Italian countryside, which was nice. The hike took about one hour, but we also stopped with some other people at a cafe on the way and tried Limoncino, which was a Cinque Terre specialty and stronger than Limoncello. We got it in a shot glass, and man that stuff was strong. Remember how I said the Limoncello was like a too sweet lemon head? Well, this definitely wasn't too sweet. It took us a bit to finish them actually, but we took our time. Afterwards, we headed back on the trail and made it to our Vernazza.

In Vernazza, we didn't have too much time because we spent so much time at that cafe, but we just sat at the beach until it was time to go, and I grabbed gelato on the way because why not? :) We waited for the train to our fourth and northern-most town, Monterosso al Mare. At this place, our tour guides told us about a bakery that sold fried bread filled with cheese, and also said that there was a good winery right next to it that sold white wine made of Cinque Terre grapes, so all of us went in search of that bakery. We found it, ordered our bread, and went next door to get our wine. The bread was fresh out of the oven, and not exactly *brimming* with cheese, but there was some in there, that was alike a sweet dessert-like cheese. The bread was like a big puffed up pita with salt on it, which was a great contrast to the sweet cheese. I actually didn't like the wine at all, but that was okay because it was special to Cinque Terre :). We headed back along the water to the train, where we took the ride all the way back south to Riomaggiore.

At Riomaggiore was apparently the best fried fish, but the place the tour guides liked the most was closed, so we just skipped it and went out to the beach. On the beach there was a hook of rocks that went out in the water, so we climbed all of those and made it to the end, which in my opinion was very difficult. My purse clapse had broken that day, so I was especially worried about my stuff falling out of my purse while climbing all of these rocks. They were slippery, but I made it!! And it was totally worth it!! The view was absolutely incredible of Riomaggiore. Not to mention, we were there exactly for sunset, so we got the sunset in the distance and the beautifully colorful town with gorgeous boats to look at. It was truly a sight to remember.

We sat on the rocks for a bit, enjoying the view, then headed back to the train station to go to La Spezia, where the bus would pick us up and take us home. I fell asleep on the bus ride back, and we walked home, made the rest of our pasta for dinner, and went to bed, exhausted but so content with the day!

Cinque Terre is like walking through a fantasy. It's hard to believe such a beautiful place can exist, with such bright colors, turquoise water, amazing beaches, and great weather. I remember seeing Cinque Terre on Pinterest and I always thought it looked so cool, and I still even now can't believe that place I saw on a picture on Pinterest that I wasn't even sure if it was real is now a place I can say I've been to. If you ever go to Florence, I highly recommend taking the day trip to Cinque Terre, because there is truly nothing like that in the world. It was gorgeous, breath taking, and I definitely audibly gasped many times throughout that trip at the beauty of the towns in front of me.
