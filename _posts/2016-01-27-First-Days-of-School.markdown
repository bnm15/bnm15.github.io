School started this past Monday! Hooray!

Just kidding, that's terrible. I'd love to just be in Spain for four months with no work. Hehe.

So I have my Operating Systems Design course on Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 AM, which makes a very tired me at the end of the day. It takes an hour to get from my house to the Leganés campus (where the engineers are), so I leave my house at 8 AM, meaning I wake up at 7:30 or so. It's definitely worth it to shower the night before and wake up with greasy hair than to wake up any earlier than 7:30.

I am the only girl in a class of about 10, classic. There are two other international students, both from the US (one Vanderbilt and one McAllister), and both on the same program although they didn't know each other before. The rest are Spaniards who are following the computer science engineering track in English, probably to increase their chances of getting a job in America or something.

The teacher seems really nice. He is laid back, and his English is good; I don't forsee any problems there. We get to choose the way we are graded. There's continuous evaluation where all of our programming assignments count for some percentage, and then at the end our final is only 30%. Also everything weighted equals to 105%, which gives us extra leeway in the end. The other choices we have are to only take the final exam, which would count as 60% of our grade, with nothing else. That means if you got 10/10 on your final, you would only end up with a 6.0/10 as your final grade (which is passing). Here in Spain everything is weighted out of 10 points. The last option you have is to take the second final, which is for those who do terribly on the first, which would count for 100% of your grade, so if you got a 8.9/10 on that, you'd end up with an 8.9. Continuous evaluation is definitely the way to go here!

I talked to one of the American students on our way back, and funny enough his name is Brennan. He's nice, and seems more normal than every other student in the class. The other American is not antisocial but he's one of those people who thinks he's the best at computer science in the world. The Spaniards are all nerds. We'll see later on how they are... but I have a feeling everyone but Brennan is expecting me to be really bad at computer science because I'm a girl. I've met students like that at Duke, too, but they're in the minority.

Next I had my first Duke class, Madrid through literature and film, which a super artsy, young teacher. She's really into culture, which seems cool and I'm interested in learning more about it. We even take some tours around Madrid during the class. She gave us a huge packet at the end to read, which I didn't like as much, but I'm just not used to humanities classes where reading actually is your homework. Gaal is the only other person in that class with me. He is a literature and history major, so I think I'll get smoked in class discussions. Already, she asked us what we thought was the best style of art to represent a city. I said movies because you can see the way people act, hear the way they talk, see the buildings, etc. It gives you more information than a still frame photo or painting. Gaal said, "Well, I think each type of art has its merits. It depends on what the artist is trying to get across, and what they want to present to the audience. There really is no best way of representning a city," and she **LOVED** that answer. I rolled my eyes to myself, realizing why I'm an engineer who likes to have concrete not vague answers. Anyways, I guess I'll have to tap into my inner politician when answering any of her questions in that class.

The last class I had on Monday was my CEH class at UC3M, which is for international students. It's history of Spain. There were a ton of people there. I didn't get to talk to all of them, but I know some are from New York. This class is a total *joke*. The teacher kept saying how he's so happy we're going to be traveling on our weekends here, and that he doesn't want to overload us to we can travel more. We are going to have homework every weekend, but it's just writing on a sheet of loose leaf some topic he chooses, whether it's describing how our weekend travels were, or this week it's what our first impressions of Spain are. Easy. We have to write an 11 page paper by the end of the semester on some topic in history, which seemed easy enough, and then he said we can have up to 3 people working on it. I was shocked. I feel like I'm in middle school! Also our final is going to be 3 short answer essays and 3 long ones, where you choose 1 of the 3 long ones to write, and he said the prompts are online...I wish I could take 4 of these classes. Speaking of that, other people in that class literally do take 4 CEH courses. Now I understand how Duke is deemed a hard school. I couldn't even comprehend before a college class that was "easy", and now I know what that's like! I'm super pumped for this class!

Then yesterday, I had my last first day of class. This was my second Duke class, about social movements. I was forced to take this class because Duke offered 3, and I can't take 1 of them, so I had to take this and Madrid through lit and film. I thought this would be cool, but he keeps emphasizing that we're going to talk about politics, and I really don't like politics. However, the topics seem interesting, and I think I can fake my way through this for 3 hours a week, pretending that politics is the most interesting and important topic in the world. There are only 2 essays for this class, both a maximum of 5 pages, so I think I got this.

Today, (Wednesday), I get to sleep in because my class doesn't start uil 12:30. What a blessing! It's also nice because my first class today is Madrid through lit and film, so if there are ever times where I just can't finish the readings, it's good to know I'll have time in the morning.

Yesterday I hung out with Hannah Busse, we met up at a coffee shop to try to plan out a weekend we could travel together. We're thinking Munich in mid-April, which is the only time and place that overlaps between us. We said, though, that it would be *terrible* if we were both here and didn't realize our dream of traveling together in Europe since we were little girls! We also went shopping a little, because there's a Brandy Melville here. I hope I don't blow all my money there!

After hanging out with her, I met up with a girl who gave us a tour of UC3M, because she has a friend who is a tourism major and wanted to practice giving a tour of Madrid. They are both really nice, and her friend actually wants to meet us later so she can practice her English. Afterwards, we went to a croquetería, which is like my heaven. Croquetas are the best food EVER. We tried some with liquid cheese in the middle (which you had to eat in one bite otherwise it would run all over), mushroom, and some type of sausage one. They were soooo good. The place was super cute, too, with mismatched plates, cups, napkins, etc. It was very Anthropologie and cute. Definitely going back there!

Tomorrow I leave for Brussels. I'm not bringing my computer because it's really unnecessary, but I'm going to try to write some blog posts on my phone and then post them when I get back. I'm excited for my first trip!
