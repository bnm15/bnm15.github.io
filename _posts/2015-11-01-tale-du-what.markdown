Two years ago I bought myself a little Tiffany blue journal with gold page edges. It was beautiful and perfect for me because it only required a few lines of writing per day. It has a page for each day of the year, and five sections on each page to track how the exact same day went over five years. I am horribly lazy at writing, so writing a bit a day seemed to be the best way to get started.

I wrote in that journal religiously for the first year, and, like the other diaries I had tried to start, decided day after day that I would rather go to bed than have to write a sentence or two in the journal. So there it sat, on my nightstand, collecting dust. I have to pat myself on the back for trying to bring it to my first year of college, but it was never used. However, my sophomore year, for whatever reason, I was reinvigorated to keep track of my daily happenings. I think it was the excitement and preparation to go abroad that motivated me to write, which got me to thinking that I would probably want to share my abroad stories with other people. And so, Tale du Jour was born.

If you know me, you know I am obsessed with France, French people, Parisians, croissants, macarons, etc. I think the French language is the most beautiful in the world, and even a picture of la tour Eiffel makes me swoon. Aussi, incorporating a French term into my blog title was a must. It took me a while to think of it, but it came to me: Tale du Jour.

I thought it was great because most people will know what du jour means, simply because it’s on some French menus. If you don’t, it means of the day. Essentially I’m entitling this blog Tale of the Day because I want to write daily and demonstrate my reverence to the French. Who knows, maybe #ODJ will replace #OOTD. :)
